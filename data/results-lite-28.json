    "msg": "So I’ve been using this method since September. Previous PB was 20:40z Started out getting a 19:25 PB after 4 weeks and then a 18:30 8 weeks later. Around the end of December did I 18:05 and then sadly got injured. Jumped on the bike for 6 weeks and simply followed the same schedule and added some more volume. When my foot felt good again I started jogging and did a couple of small sessions before doing Paris half in 1:27 after 2 weeks of running. Started training seriously with this method again mid march. This time more conservative and without the need to push more volume around threshold and easy but just keep it at the same and see how I develop. I also started running everyday instead of squeezing it in to 6 days. My body feels better and I’m always ready to go. Averaging around 6 hours a week or 70-75k without missing a day the last 12 weeks. Did a Parkrun on a slower gravel course than my usual TT loop and ran 17:50 one month ago. Signed up for a 5000m on the track and did a 17:11 this Tuesday finishing with a 3:21/km last K! Very surprised and on my way to sub 17 which I never thought would be possible for me. This clearly is working. The nature of this approach is repetitive but I love that I know what I have to do on a given day and that I always can squeeze it in no matter my schedule. My body never gets shocked with a crazy workout or long run and therefore I can stay injury free. The 7 vs 6 days and the very slow progression of volume compared to my last attempt that ended up in injury seems to make all the difference. For anyone interested schedule is now: 3x45 easy 3x10 4x6 10x3 80 easy Rinse & repeat. 4 weeks ago I added 2 repeats to the 3 minute reps. 5 min to each easy over the course of 3 weeks. Very slow progression. I follow my CTL and update paces etc. using intervals.icu tl;dr Just do the same as sirpoc and get some pbs",

Clearly if you left out the T sessions you wouldn't be improving at all unless you were a complete newbie. Everyone and their mother does Easy days - there's even entire programs built around them 'easy intervals' for example and for the most part they all SUCK. T sessions are what drives the improvement. Easy days are there primarily for RECOVERY from the T sessions - if you didnt need to recover you could just do T sessions every day. And ramping up mileage and/or speed on easy days is only slowing down the recovery process. Why this is not plain as day is beyond me but whatever. There are two guys right in a row a few pages up who are using Thresh training with basically NO easy days - they literally do NOTHING on those days - and getting the SAME type of success as Sirpoc.

Interestingly, our physiological characteristics - VO2max, threshold, fiber type - were nearly identical, but his running economy was decent, whereas I required 40% (initially) to 20% (after duathloning for a year) more energy to run at a given speed than even an untrained runner.

I actually appreciate what you have brought to the thread this far, and I think most people could agree with some, if not most of your points if you presented them from a place of mutual curiosity rather than superiority. Your point about specificity and mitochondrial biogenesis is intuitive, as it doesn’t make sense for someone to get better at running by walking (extreme example). I wonder though, are there actually a few “magic” points in intensity that have a disproportionate benefit compared to other intensity levels. Would it not make sense that the point lactate starts rising above resting levels (LT1?) be one of these? What about the point right before time to failure starts increasing rapidly disproportionately to velocity (around LT2)? Another question is the scale that running adaptations happen on. Do the majority take place on a local scale (in the muscle, mitochondria) or a global scale (cardio).

When it comes to the idea that too much quality running and not enough easy running leads to mitochondrial damage there's some evidence that could support this and a few working models of what's going on, but nothing super solid to my knowledge. A ramble on a few concepts: One theory is that too much intense exercise leads to an overproduction of reactive oxygen species overwhelms the antioxidative capacity of the mitochondria to deal with these ROS. I'm not sure if the result here is actual damage to the mitochondria or just a compensatory shutdown of metabolism (and thus production of ROS) so that they can get back to a more balanced redox environment. Another possibility is an imbalance in substrate utilization with too much intensity. I seem to recall some studies that have found disturbed glucose control and insulin sensitivity issues in elite athletes training very hard. Not sure of the exact implications here. Another theory is less about dose/damage of high intensity itself and more about what we're not doing during this type of training. If we drop overall volume and threshold work we just lose aerobic capacity over time -pretty simple. I like to think of the mitochondria less as machine-like powerhouses that we should constantly push to the limit, and more like microscopic livestock that we need to cultivate and take care of. Training serves to \"feed\" them. We need to feed them the right balance of stuff and should not abuse them. Not the best analogy but I think there's something here. I'm not sure if easy running is actively \"protective\" against mitochondrial damage/dysregulation or if its more just a general balancing of training effects. That being said, a short easy run is a nice boost of hormones and blood flow that aids in recovery and adaptation. For a high volume athlete who is very fit and very durable they can add in a daily jog to get these recovery benefits without a recovery cost. For a normal runner something like an easy walk or bike ride in the morning would probably get the job done and be safer. Going into less understood and maybe somewhat woo woo territory now, I think an important aspect of successful training is not only getting the correct training load, but balancing time between heightened, ready-to-perform, sympathetic nervous system state and the chill rebuild parasympathetic nervous system state. If we are doing much intensity we are always in ready-to-perform mode and not getting to fully rebuild from all that stress. Easy running gets/keeps us in that chill mode where actual adaptation takes place. There's plenty more models/theories/whatever about this, and ultimately not sure it really matters how we describe whats going on in the mitochondria. We have a pretty good idea of what works from all the coaches and athletes running real world experiments. The best consistently run a lot and run most that fairly easy. I don't think we need to a deep understanding of cellular biology to tell us to follow the obvious path here.",

This isn't hearsay, there's countless real people who have posted her and on Strava who have tried this for a significant period of time.

This provides a backdrop and consistency so many runners have never had, using more traditional methods. Of course, as others have said this isn't a magic pill.

In fact, I know there's a lot of talent spotting UK athletics does at stuff like this. It's a really good indicator of who might be aerobically talented, or will become it. As 90% of kids are just footballers at this point. He's mentioned this before and I totally understand the point. 2.

A really talented runner in my eyes would be running even 17:30 minimum on a Daniel's plan he followed after even just 6 months. Let alone over a year just to get 18:50. Also I believe he posted his FTP was 315 on the bike. Honestly, I hope he doesn't take this with disrespect. But that's not really talented in the slightest to be honest. Just my thoughts on the subject, but it's something interesting for sure to think about. What talent even is. Anyway, congrats to him on another PB.

It's really such a cool thread as we are not really in the dark about much. It begs the question.....if we accept he is a pretty good talent , which I'm sort of swaying towards, although not exceptional, how many other guys out there are grinding away with Daniel's 4th edition running 18-19 when their talent is being potentially stifled? They might not even know they have talent and are being held back by the regime if they are later to running as well. Let's say fiber types matters, for argument sake and they are also slow twitch like sirpoc. There might be a lot of other guys in the same situation with literally minutes more talent to unlock.

But I stuck with Daniels and it wasn’t until 3 years later that I was running in the 16s for 5K. The implication, if we take sirpoc’s results at face value (18–> 15), seems to be that I would have been able to run well into the 15s if not the 14s in my 20s using the Norwegian singles approach.

Anyway, I recall the advice seeming be that if you are going to double you should do so on easy days, not the workout days. Just curious as to why? My typical practice is to double on workout days whenever possible, with the thought being that an easy 4M run in the morning acts as a shakeout for the workout later in the day, and keeps the easy days easier.

Like a lot of this thread sometimes people get lost looking for hard rules when they really just need to use common sense and listen to their body. A case for doubling on the easy days is that the split here can keep each easy run truly easy, and you get a double dose of the blood flow, hormone boost, etc that helps you recover and adapt. There's a point of trying to scale up individual easy run duration where it becomes not so easy. Think about that point in duration where your legs start to feel heavy and it requires relatively more mental energy to keep going -one idea behind splitting the easy day into a double is that it helps manage exposure to that while still getting in a lot of volume. One key aspect of this thread is managing day-to-day effort so that there aren't huge swings in training and we can keep overall training load higher by virtue of that. Hard-days-hard and easy-days-easy is a useful heuristic for beginners that often gets overdone because people don't understand the overall goals of training. These threshold sessions can accumulate a lot of volume so adding an easy double to that day can push the daily volume way too far into \"hard\" for some people. Again it kinda depends on where the individual is at with their total volume and how they response to different sessions. For example: I'm in a situation right now where my easy days are about ~100min of running, split roughly evenly between two runs and my threshold sessions accumulate 70-80min of total running. Adding a double to that pushes it towards 100-120min total on the day, which is sometimes fine, but sometimes leaves me asking a little too much of the next easy day recovery wise. Particularly with the summer heat its a judgement call where sometimes I drop the double on my hard days and they end up being less total volume than my easy days. I'm pretty close to getting fit enough where the extra volume of doubling every workout and easy day will no longer be issue, but in this sort of transitory level of training I go against the common convention some days in favor of the overall training load. As I continue to scale up volume I will focus most of that additional volume on workout days and my training will start to look more \"conventional\" in that sense.

For this reason I'm going to experiment with 30 min doubles on 1 or 2 of the sub T days and just keep the easy days 60 min and 1 90 min lr per week. I have only been running a total of ~3 years so far and am currently hovering around 45 mpw with a max of 60 mpw for a few weeks last summer, so I don't want to overdo it.

I stagnated late last year and only improved my 5k from 17:27>17:12, but I know I have faster times in me. Races on the calendar this year for me are Grandmas Marathon (6/22) and The Bear 100M (9/27). Originally I was thinking 2:45ish should be possible for the marathon, and 22 hours for the Bear. Fast forward to February where I got a stress fracture in one of my metatarsals on my left foot which left me unable to run until 4/24. I built from 10 miles to 64 in the last two weeks using the method outlined here. My weekly schedule looked like this M - easy, T - shorter reps (25x400, 10x1K), W - Easy, Th - MLR of 10-12 miles with longer reps (5x2k, 3x2mi), F- Easy, Sat - LR of 16-19 miles with 15-20K of work typically descending ladder of 2x5k, 3k, 2k or some version of that, sun - Easy bike. Things were starting to click and I was feeling so good in training that I almost didn't want to taper for the marathon given my half baked training leading in. I ended up running 2:55 and hitting a huge wall at mile 20. I was moderately happy with the result given the hiccups in the build, but at the same time it's hard for me not to think I have a lot more left in me. I am wondering whether people here think that I would have needed a more traditional buildup with more mileage to build the strength necessary for the marathon, or if what I was lacking was more straight MP runs like Pfitz or Daniels would prescribe? Next, I am probably the first here to try and apply this training to a 100M ultramarathon where I will have a proper 16 week build. My plan here is going to be double subthreshold sessions on Tuesday and Thursday consisting of 10x1k, or 5x2k in the morning and a 30 minute uphill treadmill session at lunch (probably more like upper Z2 at 15% grade). I am wondering if anyone has thoughts here on how best to apply this to a mountain ultra. I do believe that I am getting very good results using this method and feel like I would be leaving something on the table training wise if I used the traditional ultra training that is exclusively slogging out long slow miles in the mountains (which I will do some of).

The longer the distances, the less predictive the calculators are. Sounds like you got the most out of the day. Most people slow in the last 6 miles so that's pretty normal. Hard2find and others, correct me if I'm wrong, but the pace calculators are based on a rough prediction that as the distance doubles the race pace slows about 5%. If you're aerobically well trained that holds well, except it's VERY challenging to have your MP pace just 5% slower than HMP, so the model fails for many. Not sure if you're familiar with Nate Jenkins but he's great to listen to about this. I believe he had a podcast with the poster who did the summary of this method (I recognized his voice but I think the podcast was under a different channel name). Nate thinks that highly specific marathon training from coaches like Canova is why many of the East African athletes compete well in the marathon (5% slow down) while many pros in the US can struggle to get 10-15% slow down. The specific work is needed to extend your existing fitness. That said, if Canova was coaching a hobby jogger like you or me I'm not sure he would do that much differently than this method? One way Canova thinks of it is that the base phase has little amplitude between sessions and high global volume. The specific phase is the opposite, huge sessions with very little in between, global volume is not the top priority. I'm of the opinion that the highly specific work is more appropriate for the elites who are already operating, and have been for a while, at their maximal sustainable load. Canova may think the same. If all elites are practically at their maximal sustainable load, specificity becomes the difference maker. Specificity is like improving the wheels of a car. With better wheels you can hold up better and be more efficient within your aerobic limits. For us hobby joggers the aerobic conditioning (car engine) is the biggest determiner- the car not the wheels. You do still need enough of a long run to handle the distance, but not so much that it compromises global load. About the MP block runs. I messaged Nate Jenkins on Strava a while back to see if he would give me feedback on my Canova/ Nate Jenkins inspired marathon plan. He was nice enough to take a look at it and send his feedback. I had 8,10,12, and 14 miles of straight MP tempos in the plan spread out over 12 weeks or so. His advice was to cut those into intervals and have float recoveries at 90% MP. Very similar to the ethos of this thread, his experience is that you get the stimulus and volume without the extra fatigue. This is coming from one of the hardest working and toughest runners around, so if the straight tempos made a difference that's certainly what he would advocate. People following this approach wouldn't do as much in one session, I am just giving this as an example of the straight tempo vs intervals decision. So I think your suspicions are right, you just need more time accumulating load. Just don't get injured and stay consistent. Regarding your ultra, is this your first one? If it's your first ultra, maybe do a few shorter ones first? I've done a few 50ks and a 50 miler--they are tough! For training, my suggestion would be to settle in to your maximal sustainable load akin to what others are doing on this thread and what you have already done and every 3-4 weeks do a big adventure run. 30+ miles or back to backs. So much of ultras is getting the logistics figured out, hydration, nutrition, chafing, etc and you can only do that by doing it. It may be too much too soon to jump to doubles on your quality days. Like others have suggested, it may be wise to schedule doubles on your easy days (if doubles are needed at all), and only after you know how you respond to that add in the extra load on the quality days. My other suggestion would be to drop the time goal. Just finish (survive)! I have friends who want me to do a hundred miler with them and I think they're nuts. That's so much suffering. Finishing would be an incredible achievement! You can always come back next year and try to beat your time.",
