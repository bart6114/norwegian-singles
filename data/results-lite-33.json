    "msg": "Looking for some guidance here on my HR sub treshold controlled programme. Sorry for the wall of text here… I found this thread in june and converted from a more polarized training regime to this sub threshold. Thanks a lot. Feeling stronger, healthier and have no injuries/niggles. I now run a three double sub- threshold a week. The rest is easy. Even though it sound much I have not found it taxing at all. I control and reduce impact by running some uphill on a ski slope, use treadmill inclination and run off trail on soft surface in the Forrest. I run approximately 9,5 hours a week. The easy runs and long run are at 60% off my Max HR. The morning LT1 sessions is very controlled. I sit around 153-155 in HR and my LT1 maxHR is 158 max. My max HR is 198. All from a lab test one year ago. My LT2 from the lab sits at 184 HR And stay with me soon comes my question…. When I do my LT2 sessions. I can do 6x5’ and progress it to 165 HR. I can also do 10x3’ and progress it to 170. I know this is quite a gap from 184 which is my max LT2HR but I’m doing three doubles a week. Sometimes I think I’m to conservative and sometimes I’m afraid I will overdo it if I speed up. So my question to you insightful people here if you think I’m spot on here or should go a bit higher on the HR in the LT2 sessions? And the easier LT2 sessions where I sit at 165 HR are they giving me anything? I mean that they are close to LT1 but also a bit far from LT2… At the moment I train for 10k but I will do the half marathon i the future… And yes I will probably get a lactate meter but in the meantime I need to controll it with HR.

After the 10k workout I did a month and a half ago where I finally saw a decent improvement, the humidity returned and I went back to subT work. Dewpoints are finally consistently in the 50s and sometimes 40s here and I'm seeing races pop up left and right. This weekend I did a 5kTT instead of my 3rd subT and did pretty okay I guess. I started this method around May or so, but in February I see I ran a 5k TT (moderate course, couple of long uphill sections but not terribly steep at any given point). Ran 20:57 (mile splits - 6:35,6:51,6:48, and + 0:42), was 35F out and I was in Z5 pretty much from end of mile 1, Avg HR last mile+ was 178 (Max is a few BPM above 180 these days). Was completely gassed. Ran the same route this weekend in 65F and ran 20:11 (k splits - 4:02, 4:05, 4:04, 4:05, 3:54). Avg HR last 2k was 168. I hardly reached Z5 during the effort. Felt pretty normal within a minute of finishing. I think it's pretty clear that I've made some decent aerobic progress using this method. Moving from a 5k at 6:45 pace to 6:30 while dropping my avg HR 10 BPM, even on the last mile+. But comparing the 2 TT's I'm seeing that I was clearly capable of holding my HR up much higher earlier in the year (and I doubt that I've aged out of that capability since February), so it was a bit disappointing in that regard. I don't feel like I pushed myself into what I used to consider race effort. I suspect there's a bunch of extra headroom available to me during races if I can get used to pushing into that final gear this fall. It's been talked about here that racing often may be an important part of the plan. I can now see the progress from the hot and humid summer months, but I definitely felt rusty. I've got a 10k race coming up in a couple of weeks and now that the weather's cooler I'd like to swap in that race effort periodically to get that VO2 max stimulus and get back into the mindset of \"this is a race, it's supposed to hurt, just push it.\" What's the thought on how often to race and what to do in the days leading up to it? I was thinking a 5k or 10k ever 2 or 3 weeks? What's does the week leading up to the race look like? Cut the 2 preceding subTs to 2/3 and 1/2 volume? Keep the volume and reduce the pace of the workout? I imagine it'll take a month or two to figure out how my body responds to a new change in effort but I'm curious what others are doing/have tried.",

I notice a lot of pushback from the group when someone floats the idea of doing the hills as a third workout instead of 3 sub t method sirpoc made popular. I for one am doing the X factor hills session rather than an additional sub t. I’ve experimented with both, and my results have been greater with the hills. Long runs are generally frowned upon (at least in the traditional sense) but I think there is still a huge benefit for those racing longer distances to go more than 75-90 minutes. I think using the long run with sub-t mixed in as the third session has benefits too. im not trying to derail the thread and I guess my point is we can still experiment with this method rather than follow the letter of the law that was unofficially established somewhere down the line.

Also the mental will power to just continue to slowly chip away by doing the same thing over and over.

  {
    "msg": "The \"bang for buck TSS\" idea I think is secondary to the fact that Sirpoc had massive success cycling with 3 sub T. As others have said, this is actually fairly common training in cycling, so he had that as further validation to stick to it. Then, within that framework, he uses TSS along with how his workouts are going, to triangulate the shape he's in. Pretty smart. The TSS comparison of this vs Daniels was trying to objectively say that 3 sub T generates more load than than Daniels. I think you can also get a subjective feeling for this, that Vo2 workouts ask a lot of you and then you just can do as much during the rest of the week-- TSS is just a formal way to compare it. Hard2Find had a great post earlier in the thread about the drawbacks of TSS. It is heavily biases volume over intensity. For example, 25 min at Interval, 32 min at Threshold and 53 min at Easy (all JD paces) generate 60 TSS according to Hard2Find's TSS calculator spreadsheet. The recovery needed for those workouts are ridiculously different. The take away is that TSS isn't everything, but it's a helpful metric to track consistency/ progress if you're already working within a logical training framework. I suspect that what is optimal is highly individual, and that in the vast majority of cases good training that you do consistently will always beat spotty training that may be \"ideal.\" To the posters above who say that those with success stick closely to Sirpoc's guidelines, my suspicion is that what's happening is that those people are more consistent than the people changing things up. If you create a plan that's similar but different from Sirpocs and you stick to it, you may get just as good of results. I think the reason is that the range of sub T paces/ durations is actually much broader than what Sirpoc does. But what Sirpoc works, so why change it? I think if you're following a hard/ easy approach, what Sirpoc does is probably very close to ideal. Maybe if you're weaker on the endurance side 40-45 min worth of intervals at M pace may be better than 36 min at Sub T. But now we're splitting hairs, and its probably best to just get out and run. If you're willing to break the hard/ easy approach, there are a lot of ways to generate more TSS in a week, like the 30 min at M a day that the poster above mentioned. I suspect that there will be greater variability with this kind of clustering, meaning some will do great and some will break, and the hard/ easy will probably be best for most people most of the time. But the ultimate question is, does this higher TSS convert to greater fitness and faster times? I've heard Sirpoc estimate that there may be about a 10-15% difference in performance based on how you generated your TSS. Say person A gets 60 CTL through lots of all easy running, person B through 3 sub T, and person C through a Daniels program. The variation in performance between those groups may be 10-15%, so TSS gets us in the right ballpark but isn't predictive. 3subT gets us the load with less time than plan A, and is more repeatable than plan C. I suspect the variation in performance is largely due to one's training history and general strengths/ weaknesses. For example, my 5k time is much better than my 10k time which is much better than my HM time. I suspect for me, that more volume at the lower end of the sub T range is more beneficial than the shorter reps (400s, 1000s). Below is the schedule I've experimented with for 4 weeks. I just had a break due to Covid, and am torn between picking it back up or going to the traditional 3 sub T. Monday- 1 hr with 8x 4 min LT2 Tuesday-1 hr with 45 min at LT1 (90% of M pace) 3x 15 min for example Wednesday- 90 min easy Thursday- 1 hr with 4 x 10 min at M pace and slightly quicker Friday- 1 hr with 45 min at LT1 (90% of M pace) Saturday- 1 hr easy Sunday- 1 hr with 45 min at LT1 (90% of M pace) My CTL shot up doing this vs 3 sub T. My experience is that the fatigue you get from LT1 work is completely different than the fatigue from LT2. One way to describe it is that running LT1 simulated high milage. It's still Z2 in 5 zone model work, but with 45 min at LT1 I felt like it was more like a 90 min easy run. Interestingly, this pace is about 88% of JD's T pace, which is at the low end of sweetspot for cycling. I like my easy days in the woods so I'm leaning towards going back to 3 sub T. Kinda funny, my garmin was going crazy during this period. My estimated VO2 max shot up and my estimated 5k time was in the 15s when my PR is high 17s lol. Clearly it's wrong, but maybe it's directionally correct? It's hard to tell knowing that TSS is biased towards volume/ distance. Am I just optimizing for something that isn't that important for a 5k? Maybe. Would this improve my HM? That seems likely, given how poor my HM is compared to 5k. Again, only did it for 4 weeks and then got Covid so not much of a sample size.",

    "msg": "I actually do read here when I can. But haven't really felt like I've had much to add for a while. Firstly, great post - hope you are in the Strava group (although I feel with a post like that you probably already are!). Secondly, just to state for the wider audience; I don't think there is inherently anything special about sub threshold. At all. I just think it's probably the easiest range to control, as well as the easiest to access or qualify in some way , along with seemingly fitting the various \"load\" models the best. The key being you can easily build more in, you should know where your fitness is, which will also lead to better performance. I will however, probably die on the hill of saying until I've seen evidence otherwise, for the aerobically underdeveloped runner, this is probably as good as you are gonna get in terms of bang for your buck on 5+ hours a week (with the odd tweak here or there for individuality or how a good coach might adapt slightly). Once you get to maybe 8.5-9+, again there are better ways to train (doubted t at a lower intensity). Under 5 hours (apart from just starting out) I would probably just roll the dice and do something aggressive from a Daniel's book. So that already takes out a large percentage of the population who could be doing this. Inside of that though, I do think as a cut and paste regime off the shelf, it's as likely as anything if not more so to give you success. I think, as you mention poster above, consistency is as much the key to this as any other single factor. One other point of note, yes I did say there's probably a 10% swing or so in either direction. Guys much smarter than me when it came to looking at cycling data (and some swimming) for guys who had trained various ways over various seasons - found there was actually not a huge amount of difference between plan A versus plan B versus plan C. Say a 300w on a pretty standard cycling plan of 20 years ago might get you 300w. A totally unstructured plan might get you 270-280w and something that gave you best bang for your buck, over a potentially shorter but more condensed time period (sweetspot), might gain you 320-330w. Again though, this is for time limited guys - not elite level. FWIW my data was the most outlier, in that it was almost identical for me no matter what - and I did try a totally awful training plan of just riding 2.5-3 hours a day at zone 2 (but took way longer). Is this going to be the case for running? Who knows. Runners are bad record keepers in terms of accurate data. Myself and Hard2find also talk about this most days and know that the original model TSS was built on probably has some flaws , which come down to expected power duration curves. Hard2find, if anyone, might find an alternative. If anyone can, it would be him (and to make it running specific). The other thing I will mention is cross training. If you are going to cross train I would be pretty confident in doing this plan but across whatever method you are doing alongside running. What makeup that is in terms of balance, I don't know. But shirtboy has been doing something similar and he's basically not gotten worse at running - and he's barely a runner now (I don't think he will mind me saying that 😅). Following the same plan whilst injured, or something similar with lots of cycling sweetspot also probably is a smart thing to do. Jiggymeister came back quite quickly from injury and was pretty good quite quickly with a large TSS load from cycling. So I would say the next natural progression of the thread is other people sharing not just their running experiences but also how or why maybe they have cross trained using the same basic principles.",

Other days I look at it, shake my head, and think oh well, that's just the way it's gonna be today, let's do the work and move on. Took a couple of months to figure it out but realizing that the goal isn't to hit the same or better paces than the previous week, but to get the work in an make sure your good to go again in 2 days. If the end of my workouts has me at or preferably just below LTHR, I'm normally pretty happy, but that's normally just a consequence of getting the effort level right across the entirety of the workout.

    "msg": "Hi guys! Good to see this thread still going. Just thought I would add my thoughts. Firstly, of course I agree you have to understand there is actually no pace in play here. If you look and follow sirpoc, often there's a few seconds swing either way on paces. It's not perfect! But what he does is the effort levels look very similar week to week, despite the pace. Obviously everything slowly increasing over time. It's very measured and very controlled. The original posts were a lovely guide for me to get started though. After maybe a month you start to understand and get a feeling for what the effort will be that than ends around or just below that LTHR line by that key last rep. As for myself, I am 38 year old and this year I have PR at every distance from the Mile up to marathon. My best PB was bringing my 5k down from 19:33 to 17:52 just yesterday at my local Park run. I have only been following this method, apart from 7 races over the year to date, since around Januar. The biggest breakthrough came after maybe 10 weeks and then another huge breakthrough in early September. There's no magic to this but the consistency is unreal! It's almost metronomic in that aspect. Previous 3 seasons I have struggled to get any kind of form and when I had it vanished quickly. With this I feel like I am just improving and improving, pretty much non tapering races and then still good to go and just carry on. My assumption from following sirpoc on Strava is this is how it's meant to all work and feel. Many thanks to everyone else who has contributed. There were a few other posters who also had tried it and gave me the confidence to push all the chips in on this. My running group said I was mad and would lack speed.......now they are all asking me where I found this information and who sirpoc is after me suddenly becoming the strongest runner rather than weakest in our XC relay squad. The irony. It's funny, they also claim I must be doing secret workouts as I see claims made to sirpoc himself! Anyway, I hope maybe this information might also resonate with one other person who is on the fence and to try this. I will say, have confidence in it and try and understand and follow it as close as you can. A bit of an oxymoron, but in my eyes it's as complicated and easy to get wrong as it is simple!",

I would say sporadic racing with a tiny taper like sirpoc does is a safer dynamic than then switching to the more aggressive hill repeats or vo2 work on a weekly basis. Obviously we are only comparing two people , but these are two who have likely stuck to this the longest where we have literally all the sessions available. But I worried for KI as soon as he started the regular work above Threshold. They were both doing around the same for a while and were both on around the same level. The weird thing is they were both still improving, so I'm not convinced I know why KI started to mix things up. If your PBs stop, sure, take a chance on being more aggressive. But he was still going great. Whereas sirpoc has stuck it out totally like a machine and is now miles ahead of KI level who also seems to have started picking up injuries. For the record, I count 8 5ks or parkruns that sirpoc has done since November last year. So we are sort of around once every 6-7 weeks it would seem as a blanket average. But that also includes 3 10ks and a HM in that time. I personally consider that a hell of a lot of racing in a year but I do think that helps put sprinkles on the already great system. Unfortunately where I am in the world, there is no Parkrun local to me. I think this is a big factor, as I know I would be motivated perhaps to do and do this with other people.

For the guys complaining about lack of speed work, Nobody stops you from: A) Adding a day of strides/ hill sprints, if you do it the Norway singles is quiet similar to Hudson or Pfizinger type of training plan. B) Or just increase the speed of one of the last reps. 20x400m @ 10k -> 16x400m @10k + 4x400m @ 3k 8x1k @ 15k -> 5x1k @ 15k + 2x1k @ 5k + 1k @ 15k C) or replace one of the sessions with hill reps D) Replace some sessions with races or time trials Personally I think option B) or D) are best, but the truth is this: Speed work only matters if you have a shot of winning the race, so why bother if you cant hang with the lead pack for the first 3/4 of the race. First you must be aerobic fit and that is done by milage, tempo and treshold running and this is what this method does.

I got on this thread early as it sounded too good to be true but there was enough testimony for me to give it a shot. I'm training 6.5 hours a week, also adapted it like the dude to scale down. Schedule mostly looks the same as his, but I am using time with 10*3, 5*6 and 3*10. I will add, I have added in strides on two of the four easy days. Whether that is important or not, I don't believe so. I tweaked a hamstring playing cricket and left the strides out for 7 weeks in the middle and I still did a big PB at 5k at the end of that time. Easy runs, I used the guide suggested and just have HR on my heat unit and make sure I don't go over 70% max HR. Don't pay attention to anything else. For reference, I have never been able to get to 6 hours training, I've always broken down way before getting to that point. Similar experience to everyone else? I can maybe follow a Daniel's plan for 12-15 weeks and then it just all seems to fall apart. There's often some aggressive easy running or speedwork that just finishes me off. If I was younger, I suspect I could handle this type of training more This method, I haven't had a break and still going strong and feel fresher. Sirpoc said something that stuck with me on Strava. \" I think this is the key to understanding it. It's basically given us all a perfect balance between getting enough stimulus without feeling too overloaded or breaking down. This as a consequence let's training load keep rising and rising probably past where most of us have ever got to before. This is my 5k Progression: I have tried to race/parkrun/time trial once a month. January (just before I started): 20:13 February : 20:19 (this was a couple of weeks or so in) March: 20:13 (I think this was maybe 6-7 weeks in) April: 19:56 May: 19:45 (lifetime pb 19:31) June: Too hot July: 18:56 (biggest jump even with the gap and lifetime pb) August : 18:44 September: No 5k but ran a HM PB of 1:24:02 October: 18:15 and scraped home at the end of last week in 2:57:58 for the FM. My 8th full, previous best was 3:10:44 and more out of line with my 5k at the time. My big take is that I am significantly aerobically stronger training like this, in fact hugely so. Picking off the easy gains time and time again. I doubt I will change anything up for now as I'm convinced there is still some untapped aerobic engine to release. Ultimately, this is why for the hobby jogger level this is probably the best as it allows for the consistency to untap that aerobic engine which is definitely your biggest value for money yoi can spend your training on. Anyway I've lurker here for a long time and have lurked on the excellent Strava group and just thought since it's been close to a year , at least one person might benefit from my thoughts! Before anyone adds anything, I'm not fast and this isn't a humble brag post! I just hope it helps someone else if they are on the fence about if this is for them or too good to be true.

Ultimately, this is where the average HJ'r fails and then the cycle repeats. I think that's why on the thread and on the big Strava group we see the ones who have had the biggest success are the ones who have stuck to it as close as possible and not tried to get greedy for want of a better phrase and push it on with vo2 work, hills , 300s on the track. Suddenly then, there becomes a question of \"is this sustainable?\" Or it certainly becomes more difficult to stick to the 7 days schedule laid out here. I do believe there is a large chunk of 18-22 min runners who have probably stalled and this would be a way to almost cheat and increase load. Don't forget, sirpoc himself i believe spoke about frustrations of no longer being able to push past a mid to high 18 without feeling beat up or breaking down and got stuck in the same vicious cycle we probably are all familiar with to a point.

This is probably an extra ~5-6 min per session given that he has improved his paces over time – so, very incremental and a reasonable progression for someone who has gotten fitter and is committed to doing more threshold work in one session (without turning to double threshold, which is not the point of this thread). Very interesting kicking up the long run duration as well, seems like he is able to handle the extra load well based on his recent PR! Want to hear if anyone else has started slightly modifying this schedule with some success (and in keeping with the core principles). For example, I still do three 30-36min threshold sessions (Tues/Thurs/Sun) but fit one session into my 90min long run so that I can do a light hill sprint session (~2 sets, 4-5 reps) on Saturday that over time doesn't leave me too sore/tired for threshold the following day. Dropped my mile time by 10 seconds recently doing this, and has helped me progress the intensity of my threshold effort (same effort, just happens to be a bit faster) too it seems. 5k pace feels much easier on race day (also PR'd by 20 seconds). Having a great time so far, feeling strong, quick and snappy, not remotely burnt out. Thanks parkerjohn for keeping the productive convo going.",

    "msg": "I do wonder, if trolls are here to troll or just they don't understand actually what threshold is? Either way, I guess from his recent racing sirpoc LTHR is likely in the 177-179 range? Recent HM as a guide. He sometimes touches this maybe by the end of the last rep for a minute or two, but certainly not always Look look at his HR in 10*1k WAY above threshold classic 'pace' at the weekend , but I think HR topped out around 175 by rep 10. It's all about pace versus duration. I think that's what he has worked out as almost a cheat code to keep a remarkable run of training just keeping going over and over again. This seems to have been adapted for himself, combining a lot of different methods through trial and error. If you take his Vdot threshold, that's around 3:19-3:20. Yet he can easily complete 10*1k in 3:12-13 average without probably ever going over threshold. It would be nice to hear from him with regards as to how easy this felt or how many more reps he could do on top of the 10? IMO this would be a good clue as to how hard this really is for him. What stuck me was the explanation I think he wrote on Strava. This is MORE aggressive than doubles, but still on the cautious side. You are trying to get as much as you can out on just a single session as opposed to doubles, but also making sure you don't get burnt, playing with fire and that you can still run and complete a workout again in 48 hours. It's a highwire act that requires real discipline and understanding of what the bigger picture is. I imagineas you get way more experienced training like this, you can get closer to looking over the edge into the abyss but never falling into that slope of no return. Whereas starting out, it makes sense to just very much stay on the cautious side until you get a grip and handle on things. I was incredibly sceptical myself of this approach and thread earlier in the year but having seen genuine actual improvement , especially in the 5k-HM range for so many people, it's become hard to ignore to be honest. If you aren't considering this at some point as an older time crunched runner, you are probably on the wrong path. Does it work for everyone? Clearly not. As a blanket approach across the board? I'm not sure there is likely something that would suit or benefit a larger percentage of runners out there at the moment.",
