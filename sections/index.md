# Introduction {.unnumbered}

This guide introduces the "Norwegian Singles" training approach, adapted from the high-volume Norwegian model often associated with double threshold sessions. This "singles" variant emphasizes frequent, *single* sub-threshold workouts per day, suitable for runners seeking sustainable improvement in aerobic capacity and performance over the long term, particularly those training 5-9 hours per week. The core idea is maximizing repeatable training load while managing fatigue.

## Background & conceptualization

This section provides some additional context on the origins and popularization of the "Norwegian Singles" training method, particularly within the online running community.

The method is an adaptation of principles popularized by Norwegian athletes, modified to exclude the use of lactate meters. The core idea involves performing three sub-threshold workouts per week, supplemented only by easy running.

The popularization within the online community, particularly on platforms like Letsrun and Strava, was significantly driven by the user "sirpoc." His journey reportedly began by analyzing the Strava data of Kristoffer Ingebrigtsen (a non-professional, hobby-jogging member of the Ingebrigtsen family known for their elite running success) and experimenting with replicating aspects of that training.

A key figure in promoting this approach is the online running personality known as "sirpoc." He documented his significant improvements as a masters runner (improving from a 19-minute 5k runner to achieving times in the mid-to-low 15s for 5k, mid-31s for 10k, and a 1:10 half marathon) using this method after the age of 40.
