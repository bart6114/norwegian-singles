    "text": "Background & conceptualization\nThis section provides some additional context on the origins and popularization of the “Norwegian Singles” training method, particularly within the online running community.\nThe method is an adaptation of principles popularized by Norwegian athletes, modified to exclude the use of lactate meters. The core idea involves performing three sub-threshold workouts per week, supplemented only by easy running.\nThe popularization within the online community, particularly on platforms like Letsrun and Strava, was significantly driven by the user “sirpoc.” His journey reportedly began by analyzing the Strava data of Kristoffer Ingebrigtsen (a non-professional, hobby-jogging member of the Ingebrigtsen family known for their elite running success) and experimenting with replicating aspects of that training.\nA key figure in promoting this approach is the online running personality known as “sirpoc.” He documented his significant improvements as a masters runner (improving from a 19-minute 5k runner to achieving times in the mid-to-low 15s for 5k, mid-31s for 10k, and a 1:10 half marathon) using this method after the age of 40.\nFurther discussion and details can be found in the following resources:\n\nOriginal Letsrun Thread: A very long but often informative thread detailing the development and discussion of the method. Sirpoc’s early posts and a summary on page 80 are particularly relevant. https://www.letsrun.com/forum/flat_read.php?thread=12130781 (Note: The user suggests skipping posts by certain individuals for a more focused read).\nStrava Group: A dedicated group for discussion and community around the training method. https://strava.app.link/QyAqunp07Pb (Sirpoc is an admin).\nPace Guide: Lactrace.com now hosts a pace guide based on sirpoc’s recommendations. https://lactrace.com/norwegian-singles\nExecutive Summary Document: “The Norwegian single approach” - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OUk4lHlMzLkYzJAhlJAeaoj9OQNJH6g7uS31fl1To4Q/edit?tab=t.0\nTraining Calculator: Spreadsheet for calculating reps, times, paces - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ah9qBF5zBvXh0-eWefJKUQUbWS6IWfrXm4D3dfvXuBA/edit?gid=0#gid=0\nSummary Website: https://sites.google.com/view/sub-threshold/home",

    "text": "1.1 Sub-Threshold Focus\nThe primary goal is to shift the lactate curve rightward, allowing higher speeds at lower lactate concentrations. Quality training primarily occurs just below the second lactate threshold (LT2), often termed “sweetspot” or high Zone 3/low Zone 4 (in a 5-zone model). This intensity provides significant aerobic stimulus with manageable fatigue, forming the bulk (~20-25% of weekly time) of the training load. High-intensity VO2max work is generally avoided or minimized in this phase due to its high cost-to-benefit ratio for general preparation.",

    "text": "1.2 Intensity Control\nThis is crucial. Avoid exceeding LT2 during quality sessions. Precise control allows for frequent, repeatable quality work. Erring slightly slower is safer than going too fast. Monitoring methods include:\n\nLactate Meter (Ideal): Target levels are typically between 2.0-4.0 mmol/L, ensuring you remain below LT2. Many practitioners recommend aiming for the lower end, potentially capping efforts around 2.5-3.0 mmol/L, to ensure sustainability and avoid creeping over the threshold, though individual responses vary. Consistent monitoring helps ensure levels don’t consistently exceed LT2 towards the end of the final reps. Requires understanding of personal lactate curve and consistent testing protocol. Lactate testing provides the most direct measure of internal load.\nHeart Rate (Proxy): Use a reliable Lactate Threshold Heart Rate (LTHR) estimate (e.g., Friel’s 30-min test). Aim for sub-threshold zones, perhaps capping effort around 90-92% of Max HR or just below LTHR. Be mindful of HR lag, drift (especially in heat/humidity), and external factors (sleep, stress). The correlation between HR and lactate can vary significantly day-to-day and between individuals; HR is often better used as a ceiling than a precise target, especially as fitness increases or in variable conditions. LTHR itself is generally stable for trained runners.\nPace (Proxy): Use paces derived from current race fitness (e.g., recent 5k/10k time trials or races, ideally within 4-8 weeks). Paces need adjustment based on interval duration (faster for shorter reps, slower for longer reps) and conditions (heat, humidity, wind, terrain). VDOT or Tinman calculators can provide starting points, but individual responses vary. Consistency of terrain (track, flat road, treadmill) improves pace reliability.\nPower (Proxy): Running power meters (like Stryd or watch-based estimates) offer another intensity gauge, more responsive than HR and potentially accounting for grade. Critical Power (CP) estimates can correlate well with LT2. Accuracy and consistency across devices/conditions (especially wind) are still evolving and may vary between individuals.\nPerceived Exertion (RPE): Sessions should feel “comfortably hard” (e.g., RPE 5-6/10) – challenging but sustainable, allowing conversation in short bursts. You should feel capable of doing another rep but adhere to the plan. RPE can be skewed by previous training habits or external factors.",

A rest day can replace an easy day if needed (E-Q-E-Q-R-Q-LR), but the 7-day structure maximizes consistent load. Combining quality work into the long run is generally discouraged as it disrupts the load/recovery balance (though marathon adaptations exist).

    "text": "2.2 Quality Workouts (Sub-Threshold)\n\nFormat: Intervals with relatively short rest. Rest can be standing, walking, or slow jogging. The key is maintaining the sub-threshold effort during the work interval.\nVolume: Aim for total sub-threshold work to be 20-25% of your total weekly running time. Start conservatively (e.g., 20-25 mins total work per session) and build gradually. For lower weekly volumes (e.g., &lt;5 hours), maintaining 3 sessions might mean shorter workout durations.\nTime vs. Distance: Using time-based intervals (e.g., 10 x 3 min) instead of distance (e.g., 10 x 1k) ensures consistent workout duration regardless of pace, which can be beneficial for consistency and comparing load across different ability levels. However, distance-based intervals are also common.\nPacing: Remember LT2 is an effort level over time, not a fixed speed. Shorter intervals can be run slightly faster than longer intervals while maintaining the same sub-threshold physiological state. Use current fitness and monitoring tools (lactate, HR, power, RPE) to guide pace. Some athletes may also use specific calculators or guides, such as the Lactrace paceguide, to calculate optimal zones.\nExample Distance-Based Workouts (Paces are approximate guides, adjust based on individual LT2):\n\n\n\nDistance\nPace Guide\nRest\n\n\n\n\n3000m\n~25k-30k pace\n120s\n\n\n2000m\n~21.1k-25k pace\n90s\n\n\n1600m\n~10 mile pace\n60s-90s\n\n\n1000m\n~10k to &lt;15k pace\n60s\n\n\n\nExample Time-Based Workouts (adjust reps/duration based on total weekly time target):\n\n10-12 x 3 min (Rest: 60s) @ ~15k pace effort\n25 x 1 min (Rest: 30s) @ ~10k/CV pace effort\n6-8 x 5-6 min (Rest: 60s) @ ~10 mile pace effort\n5-6 x 6-8 min (Rest: 60s) @ ~Half Marathon pace effort\n3-4 x 10-12 min (Rest: 60-120s) @ ~Half Marathon to 30k pace effort\n3-4 x 15 min (Rest: 90-120s) @ ~30k pace effort (often used in marathon builds)\n\nVariety: While consistency is key, rotating through different interval formats (e.g., 10x1k Tue, 5x2k Thu, 3x3k Sat) can provide slightly different stimuli and prevent monotony. The physiological benefit difference between formats at the same sub-threshold state is debated, but variety is often beneficial psychologically.",

    "text": "4.10 Alternative Monitoring Methods\nFor athletes who don’t have access to lactate meters, several alternatives can help monitor sub-threshold training intensity:\nSuunto ZoneSense uses HRV and a proprietary DDFA algorithm to determine LT1/LT2 thresholds in real-time. Requires a recent Suunto watch (9 Peak or newer) paired with an RR interval chest strap (Polar H10, Garmin HRM). Works well for longer intervals (3+ minutes) but needs steady-state efforts for accuracy, making it less suitable for shorter intervals like 10x1k.\nTymewear VitalPro (~$299) combines heart rate and respiratory rate monitoring to identify ventilatory thresholds (VT1/VT2), which correlate with LT1/LT2. Uses a 4-zone model where the top of zone 3/bottom of zone 4 represents the Norwegian Singles sweet spot. Requires smartphone app for data viewing and works best with post-workout analysis to refine pacing.\nCritical Power (CP) requires a running power meter (Stryd ~$200, or watch-based estimates from Garmin/Polar). Test CP using 3-min/12-min or 20-min protocols, then target 85-95% CP for sub-threshold intervals (shorter intervals ~90-95% CP, longer intervals ~80-85% CP). Power provides consistent guidance across varying conditions but accuracy varies between devices.\nTalk Test is a free method using breathing patterns and conversation ability. At sub-threshold pace, you should be able to speak 3-5 words between breaths with controlled but elevated breathing. It should feel “comfortably hard” - if unable to speak at all, intensity is too high.\nEnhanced RPE uses a detailed 1-10 scale: 4-5 (too easy), 5-6 (target “comfortably hard” zone), 6-7 (upper sustainable limit), 7+ (too hard, decrease pace). Best combined with regular time trials for calibration.\nTraining Apps like TrainingPeaks, Strava Premium, or HRV4Training analyze workout data patterns over time to estimate threshold zones. Most effective when combined with periodic time trials for validation.\nComparison of Methods\n\n\n\nMethod\nCost\nReal-time\nAccuracy\nEase of Use\n\n\n\n\nLactate Meter\n$200-400\nNo\nHighest\nModerate\n\n\nSuunto ZoneSense\n$400-600\nYes\nHigh\nHigh\n\n\nTymewear VitalPro\n$299\nLimited\nHigh\nModerate\n\n\nPower Meter\n$200-400\nYes\nHigh\nModerate\n\n\nTalk Test\nFree\nYes\nModerate\nHigh\n\n\nEnhanced RPE\nFree\nYes\nModerate\nHigh",

This is often done instead of a mid-week quality session.\nLonger Sub-Threshold Reps: Replacing standard sessions with longer intervals like 3x5k, 4x5k, or even 5x5k at sub-threshold effort, particularly in the later stages of the marathon block.\nMarathon Pace Workouts: Introducing specific MP workouts, sometimes as tempos (e.g., 10k @ MP) within a medium-long run, especially closer to the race.\nFueling/Hydration Practice: These longer sessions are crucial for practicing race-day nutrition and hydration strategies. Consistency and high volume remain vital, but marathon-specific long runs and targeted MP work are generally considered necessary additions or modifications to the base ‘singles’ structure.",

Running three easy runs per week for more than an hour each starts raising the injury risk, as does running more than 40-50 minutes or 10-12k for quality intervals.

The “singles” approach aims to adapt the core principle of controlled threshold work for lower-volume runners, often as an alternative to traditional amateur plans that frequently incorporate higher intensities (like VO2max work) which can lead to injury or burnout.\nNorwegian Singles concentrates on consistent sub-threshold work (3x weekly) with minimal intensity variation, while Daniels prescribes multiple intensity zones (Easy, Marathon, Threshold, Interval, Repetition) with scheduled workouts that often exceed LT2.

Jakob Ingebrigtsen is also known to incorporate a hard hill session every Saturday AM, with “easy threshold” in the evening, for a total of 6 sessions each week. Of course, the double threshold approach allows one to incorporate more sub-threshold training each week, but it is much more demanding on the body and requires more experience.
