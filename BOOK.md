# Norwegian Singles Training: A Concise Guide

This guide introduces the "Norwegian Singles" training approach, adapted from the high-volume Norwegian model often associated with double threshold sessions. This "singles" variant emphasizes frequent, *single* sub-threshold workouts per day, suitable for runners seeking sustainable improvement in aerobic capacity and performance over the long term, particularly those training 5-9 hours per week. The core idea is maximizing repeatable training load while managing fatigue.

## Core Principles

*   **Sub-Threshold Focus:** Quality training primarily occurs just below the second lactate threshold (LT2), often termed "sweetspot" or high Zone 3/low Zone 4 (in a 5-zone model). This intensity provides significant aerobic stimulus with manageable fatigue, forming the bulk (~20-25% of weekly *time*) of the training load.
*   **Intensity Control:** This is crucial. Avoid exceeding LT2 during quality sessions. Precise control allows for frequent, repeatable quality work. Erring slightly slower is safer than going too fast. Monitoring methods include:
    *   **Lactate Meter (Ideal):** Target levels are often cited as 2.5-3.5 mmol/L, ensuring levels don't consistently exceed 4.0 mmol/L towards the end of the final reps. Requires understanding of personal lactate curve and consistent testing protocol. Some find their LT2 is lower (e.g., 2.8-3.0 mmol/L) or higher. Lactate testing provides the most direct measure of internal load.
    *   **Heart Rate (Proxy):** Use a reliable Lactate Threshold Heart Rate (LTHR) estimate (e.g., Friel's 30-min test). Aim for sub-threshold zones, perhaps capping effort around 90-92% of Max HR or just below LTHR. Be mindful of HR lag, drift (especially in heat/humidity), and external factors (sleep, stress). Correlation between HR and lactate can vary significantly; HR is often better used as a ceiling than a precise target, especially as fitness increases or in variable conditions. LTHR itself is generally stable for trained runners.
    *   **Pace (Proxy):** Use paces derived from *current* race fitness (e.g., recent 5k/10k time trials or races, ideally within 4-8 weeks). Paces need adjustment based on interval duration (faster for shorter reps, slower for longer reps) and *conditions* (heat, humidity, wind, terrain). VDOT or Tinman calculators can provide starting points, but individual responses vary. Consistency of terrain (track, flat road, treadmill) improves pace reliability.
    *   **Power (Proxy):** Running power meters (like Stryd or watch-based estimates) offer another intensity gauge, more responsive than HR and potentially accounting for grade. Critical Power (CP) estimates can correlate well with LT2. Accuracy and consistency across devices/conditions (especially wind) are still evolving and may vary between individuals.
    *   **Perceived Exertion (RPE):** Sessions should feel "comfortably hard" (e.g., RPE 5-6/10) â€“ challenging but sustainable, allowing conversation in short bursts. You should feel capable of doing another rep but adhere to the plan. RPE can be skewed by previous training habits or external factors.
*   **Easy Recovery:** Non-quality runs *must* be genuinely easy to facilitate recovery. Aim for efforts below 70% of Max HR or ~65% of Maximal Aerobic Speed (MAS). Monitor for low cardiac drift after the initial warm-up period. Slow down as needed, even walking hills; recovery is paramount. This allows for the high frequency of quality sessions.
*   **Consistency & Repeatability:** The system's effectiveness stems from consistent application over months and years. Workouts are designed to be repeatable weekly with minimal burnout or injury risk *if intensity is controlled*.

## Implementing the Method (Singles Approach)

*   **Weekly Structure:** The standard recommendation is 3 quality (sub-threshold) sessions per week, interspersed with 3-4 easy runs, following a pattern like E-Q-E-Q-E-Q-LR(Easy). One easy run might be longer (75-90 mins often sufficient for up to HM). A rest day can replace an easy day if needed (E-Q-E-Q-R-Q-LR), but the 7-day structure maximizes consistent load. Combining quality work into the long run is generally discouraged as it disrupts the load/recovery balance (though marathon adaptations exist). For higher volumes (e.g., 9+ hours/week), adding easy doubles on easy days is often preferred over extending single runs or adding volume around Q sessions initially.
*   **Quality Workouts (Sub-Threshold):**
    *   **Format:** Intervals with short rest (typically 60 seconds; maybe 90-120s for very long reps like 3k+, or 30-45s for very short reps <1min). Rest can be standing, walking, or slow jogging.
    *   **Volume:** Aim for total sub-threshold work to be 20-25% of your total weekly running *time*. Start conservatively (e.g., 20-25 mins total work per session) and build gradually. For lower weekly volumes (e.g., <5 hours), maintaining 3 sessions might mean shorter workout durations.
    *   **Time vs. Distance:** Using time-based intervals (e.g., 10 x 3 min) instead of distance (e.g., 10 x 1k) ensures consistent workout duration regardless of pace, which can be beneficial for consistency and comparing load across different ability levels.
    *   **Examples (adjust reps/duration based on total weekly time target):**
        *   `10-12 x 3 min` (Rest: 60s) @ ~15k pace effort
        *   `25 x 1 min` (Rest: 30s) @ ~10k/CV pace effort
        *   `6-8 x 5-6 min` (Rest: 60s) @ ~10 mile pace effort
        *   `5-6 x 6-8 min` (Rest: 60s) @ ~Half Marathon pace effort
        *   `3-4 x 10-12 min` (Rest: 60-120s) @ ~Half Marathon to 30k pace effort
        *   `3-4 x 15 min` (Rest: 90-120s) @ ~30k pace effort (often used in marathon builds)
    *   **Variety:** While consistency is key, rotating through different interval formats (e.g., 10x3min Tue, 5x6min Thu, 3x10min Sat) can provide slightly different stimuli and prevent monotony. The physiological benefit difference between formats at the same sub-threshold state is debated, but variety may help.
*   **Progression:**
    *   Increase the *duration* or *number* of sub-threshold reps slowly.
    *   Increase overall weekly running time (mostly via easy runs) proportionally to maintain the ~75/25 easy/quality split.
    *   Regularly update target paces/HR zones based on recent (within 4-8 weeks) races or time trials.
    *   Monitor Training Load (see below) and listen to your body.

## Training Load (CTL/TSS)

*   **Concept:** Training Stress Score (TSS) or similar metrics attempt to quantify the stress of a single workout based on duration and intensity relative to your threshold. Chronic Training Load (CTL) is a rolling average (often 42 days, exponentially weighted) of daily TSS, representing your fitness or sustainable load.
*   **Application:** This method allows for accumulating a high CTL due to the repeatability of sub-threshold work. Many users find a correlation between increasing CTL and improved performance, though it's not a perfect predictor and the absolute value isn't comparable between individuals. Tracking your own CTL trend is key.
*   **Tracking:** Tools like Intervals.icu, TrainingPeaks, or Runalyze calculate TSS/CTL. Consistent data input (accurate threshold values, chosen metric) is key. Pace-based TSS (rTSS) is often preferred for consistency if running routes/conditions are stable, but requires accurate threshold pace updates.

## Individualization & Considerations

*   **Pace Setting:** Use *current* fitness. Erring slightly slower is safer than going too fast, especially initially. Some find the commonly suggested paces too fast and need to adjust significantly downwards based on lactate or HR, particularly if more fast-twitch dominant or less aerobically developed. Paces are guides; effort/internal load is the target.
*   **Heat/Humidity:** Environmental conditions drastically affect performance. Significantly slow down paces in heat/humidity to maintain the correct sub-threshold effort. HR becomes less reliable as a guide in these conditions due to cardiac drift caused by heat stress. Focus on RPE and adjust pace downwards as needed.
*   **Racing/Time Trials:** Frequent racing (e.g., parkruns) or time trials (e.g., 3k-5k every 4-8 weeks) are highly recommended. They provide neuromuscular stimulus, help break plateaus, allow practice at race effort ("remembering how to hurt"), and provide benchmarks to update training paces. Initial races after a long block of only sub-T work might feel flat or sluggish ("racing rust") before the body readjusts to higher intensities.
*   **Adaptation Time & Stagnation:** Expect 4-8 weeks (or longer, especially for FT types or those new to structured training) to adapt. Significant breakthroughs often occur after longer periods of consistent application (3-6+ months). Periods of apparent stagnation are common and often precede performance jumps. Consistency through these phases is crucial.
*   **Muscle Fiber Type:** The method appears very effective for slow-twitch (ST) dominant runners. More fast-twitch (FT) runners might still benefit significantly but may need careful load management, potentially slower paces initially, a longer adaptation period, or consider replacing one Q session with hills/strides if plateaus occur, though the core method is often sufficient even for FT types.
*   **Long Run:** 75-90 mins easy is often adequate for 5k-HM focus. Its role is primarily recovery and contributing to overall volume, rather than being a key high-stress workout itself. Marathon training requires longer runs (see below).
*   **Speed Work/Strides/Strength:** The core method often excludes specific speed work or strength training. Neuromuscular stimulus comes from sub-T paces and occasional races/TTs. Strides (e.g., 6-8 x 15-30s) can be added 1-2 times per week after easy runs if desired, typically without compromising recovery. Some FT athletes might benefit more from strides or occasional short hill sprints (e.g., 6-10 x 8-10s). Strength training is debated; some find it beneficial for injury prevention or power, while others find it adds too much fatigue and compromises the 3x weekly quality sessions. Sirpoc's success without strength/strides is notable. If included, keep it light and ensure it doesn't impede recovery for running workouts.
*   **Fueling:** Adequate carbohydrate intake is important to support the 3x weekly quality sessions and prevent glycogen depletion. Fuel well before and particularly in the hours after sub-T sessions. Increased training load may require increased overall caloric intake.
*   **Cross-Training:** Can be used to supplement volume or substitute sessions during injury recovery, mimicking the E-Q-E-Q-E-Q-LR structure using modalities like cycling, elliptical, or arc trainer, focusing on similar durations and sub-threshold efforts.

## Applicability to Different Distances

*   **5k to Half Marathon:** This is the sweet spot where the method seems most directly applicable and has shown significant success for many hobby joggers. Regular racing/TTs provide sufficient speed stimulus.
*   **1500m/Mile:** The strong aerobic base built is highly beneficial. May be sufficient on its own, with races providing speed stimulus. Some suggest adding strides, weekly hill sprints (e.g., 10x30s), or replacing a Q session with faster reps (e.g., 300s/400s at race pace) periodically or in a pre-competition phase.
*   **800m:** Likely requires more specific speed, power, and anaerobic capacity work than this method provides. While the aerobic base is helpful, dedicated 800m training approaches are probably more suitable.
*   **Marathon:** Applying the core 3x weekly sub-T structure requires adaptation for the marathon. Common strategies include:
    *   **Extending the Long Run:** Gradually increasing the duration, often towards 2-3 hours, primarily at an easy effort.
    *   **Incorporating Quality into the LR:** Some runners integrate sub-threshold or marathon pace (MP) work towards the end of the long run, such as `3 x 10 minutes @ HMP` with short rests, or a continuous `30-minute block @ MP`. This is often done instead of a mid-week quality session.
    *   **Longer Sub-Threshold Reps:** Replacing standard sessions with longer intervals like `3x5k`, `4x5k`, or even `5x5k` at sub-threshold effort, particularly in the later stages of the marathon block.
    *   **Marathon Pace Workouts:** Introducing specific MP workouts, sometimes as tempos (e.g., `10k @ MP`) within a medium-long run, especially closer to the race.
    *   **Fueling/Hydration Practice:** These longer sessions are crucial for practicing race-day nutrition and hydration strategies.
    Consistency and high volume remain vital, but marathon-specific long runs and targeted MP work are generally considered necessary additions or modifications to the base 'singles' structure.
*   **Ultramarathons:** Even more experimental. Requires very high volume and race-specific long runs (back-to-backs, runs with significant elevation). Some might experiment with double-threshold days (e.g., AM track session, PM uphill treadmill session) but this significantly increases load and risk. Logistics like fueling, hydration, and gear become critical.
*   **Cadence/Form:** Running form, including cadence, is highly individual. While some proponents of this method exhibit very high cadence (e.g., >200 spm during races), it's generally considered an outcome of training and individual biomechanics rather than a specific target to manipulate. Focusing on consistent, controlled effort is more important than consciously altering form aspects like cadence, which may not be necessary or beneficial for all runners.

## Benefits and Monitoring

*   **Pros:** High sustainable training load, significant aerobic development, potential for consistent PBs across various distances (especially 5k-HM), reduced injury risk compared to high-intensity plans (if intensity is controlled), effective for time-crunched runners (5-9 hours/week often cited), repeatable and relatively simple structure. Notably effective for masters athletes seeking continued improvement.
*   **Cons:** Requires discipline to control intensity, can be monotonous for some, less focus on top-end speed/VO2max (may need occasional strides/races), adaptation takes time and may involve plateaus.
*   **Monitoring:** Use regular (4-8 weeks) races or time trials (e.g., 5k) to gauge fitness and update training zones/paces. Track CTL to monitor load progression relative to your history. Listen to your body for signs of excessive fatigue or needing to adjust intensity down (RPE, motivation, recovery between sessions, sleep quality).

## Comparative Analysis: Norwegian Singles vs. Other Training Methodologies

This section presents a concise comparison between Norwegian Singles and other established training approaches.

*   **Norwegian Singles vs. Daniels' Running Formula:** Norwegian Singles concentrates on consistent sub-threshold work (3x weekly) with minimal intensity variation, while Daniels prescribes multiple intensity zones (Easy, Marathon, Threshold, Interval, Repetition) with scheduled workouts that often exceed LT2. Daniels uses distinct training phases with changing workout types, whereas Norwegian Singles maintains the same workout structure year-round with gradual progression.
*   **Norwegian Singles vs. Lydiard Method:** Norwegian Singles employs a consistent year-round approach with sub-threshold as the primary quality intensity, while Lydiard uses sequential training phases (aerobic base â†’ hills â†’ speed â†’ race-specific). Norwegian Singles maintains moderate long runs (75-90 mins for 5k-HM) at easy pace, whereas Lydiard emphasizes very long aerobic runs during base phase followed by increasing anaerobic work in later phases.
*   **Norwegian Singles vs. Pfitzinger Method:** Norwegian Singles distributes quality evenly through the week (E-Q-E-Q-E-Q-LR) focusing primarily on sub-threshold work, while Pfitzinger incorporates medium-long midweek runs and uses more varied intensities (including VO2max and specific race-pace work). Pfitzinger's plans are explicitly designed with marathon-specific elements and feature more complex mesocycle periodization rather than Norwegian Singles' consistent weekly pattern.
*   **Norwegian Singles vs. 80/20 Running:** Norwegian Singles dedicates ~20-25% of training to sub-threshold work (just below LT2), while 80/20 distributes 20% of training across a wider range of moderate-to-high intensities with significant work above LT2. The key difference is that Norwegian Singles concentrates quality in a narrow intensity band (high Zone 3/low Zone 4) rather than employing the polarized approach of 80/20 which emphasizes separation between easy (Zone 1-2) and hard (Zone 4-5) work.
*   **Key Differentiating Factors of Norwegian Singles:** What makes Norwegian Singles distinctive is its high frequency of quality sessions (3x weekly) at carefully controlled sub-threshold intensity, enabling consistency over long periods with minimal burnout risk. It emphasizes precise intensity control to maximize repeatability and sustainable progression, with less supplementary work (strides, hills, strength) than other systems. This approach is particularly suited for time-limited runners, slower recoverers, and those seeking long-term sustainable development.
