I never have to commit a ton of time to a weekend (or heaven forbid mid-week) long run. I think my longest runs are around 85 minutes. I never wake up feeling drained from the sessions the day before. The lack of periodized training is (to me) a feature, not a bug - because I never get that burnt out by training and never need to take weeks off after peaking for an \"A\" race. But it's not the only way to train. We discussed Tinman a few pages back; he famously promoted the Critical Velocity system that worked great for so many high school runners; many of which are running well less than the ~7 hours a week that's being committed to this system. Hell, many high schoolers are probably only putting in 3.5 - 4 hours a week across Monday - Friday school days. If that's all a coach can get from them, then they need something more intense to optimize their training load - something like Critical Velocity is great for that. Sub-elites and Elites (or just hobbyists with way more time) putting in 80+ miles a week can structure things differently, because they have the bandwidth to include workouts like longer LRs, MLRs, literal double thresholds, etc. It's yet again an entirely different set of constraints (to borrow a word or concept from Magness).

I have a lactate meter and in order for me to keep my lactate <4 (I personally aim for somewhere between 3.0-3.5) I have to run slower by a significant amount (15-20 seconds/mile) to stay under threshold. It could be because I am not as aerobically as fit as sirpoc and others, I'm not quite sure. Before you ask, I plugged in a 5k time trial result done untapered in non-carbon fiber shoes to generate my suggested 4min, 8min, 12min workout pace. What I've found is that if the intervals even feel slightly hard then my lactate reading at the end is usually >4. Additionally, I would recommend against trying to correlate HR with lactate levels (obviously if your HR is 200 your lactate is going to be high and vice versa) but I've done workouts where my HR has stayed relatively low and my lactate reading was 6.X Overall, I think purchasing the lactate meter has been helpful for my situation or else I would be frying myself trying to hit the suggested interval paces when they seem to not quite fit the bill for me",

I've always suspected a basic marathon training plan is actually probably the best \"traditional\" way to train, in the sense you see a lot of guys collect PBs on the way to a marathon, simply because they are doing more. I'm at the point now where anymore time spent training, would be smarter to spread into doubles, at least some of the week. That won't be me though, I'll probably just carry on until I fall apart finally and then disappear back into being a non runner 😅 Once you are past that 8.5-9 hour range doubles are best and then in my opinion nobody needs me, my ideas or my opinion on any of that. Bakken, Jakob and his crew etc . (And others) have pretty much solved probably the best way for guys to train, who have pro level hours available. The one thing I still stand by, all this time on - is that this is still \"probably\" the best way I could have possibly trained, given time constraints of 5+ hours a week (originally) up to around 8.5 hours. The real secret is the structure and recovery aspects compared to other systems though, is I have managed to make it up to 8+ hours regular a week and build such a big base.

Again, I think highly of this method, but the exact paces may need to be modified for some people because it is very easy to go over threshold without realizing it.

Not there yet but being inspired by Sirpoc and on 25 consecutive days streak now I am already seeing my highest power numbers. This method is great, I am never exhausted and actually looking forward to the Q days (I am doing 2-2.5hr of subthreshold a week as it's less straining on the bike). It gave me some hope I can still make some progress at my very recreational level.",

    "msg": "Thanks to the person who organised all of the valuable info in this thread onto the website below: I'd browsed the thread a few times, but always gave up after a few pages because the useful stuff just got crowded out by all the noise. I guess I'm pretty late to this, but I've been doing Double Threshold regularly since July last year and had a huge breakthrough after just 9 weeks of doing it. I'm now 35 years old and I've been running consistently for 11 years (after stopping for 5 years from the ages of 19-24). I stagnated at around mid-17s for 5k (even regressed back to 18 mins) at the age of 32, until I started using cross training as a way to do a modified version of Double threshold. I achieved good results with this at first, going from mid-17 down to 16:28 for 5k, and from 36:50 down to 34:47 for 10k. Half Marathon also came down from 1:27-high to 1:18. But then I seemed to plateau again, which prompted me to finally get the nerve to do actual Double Threshold (both as runs). I read everything I could by Marius Bakken, listened to every podcast of elites who used the system and took on any piece of advice by coaches who programmed Double T, and then devised my own system using HR and the data I'd collected from my previous HMs, Marathons and all the threshold running I'd done up to that point. I reckoned that the top end of my LT1 HR was 154 (based on the steady state I was in during the first half of Marathons) and my LT2 was 163 (based on the same but during HMs). And then I essentially just copied the Ingebrigtsen workouts but with the volume scaled down (started at 4 x 6 mins for the morning and 12 x 400m for the evening), the rest slightly adjusted (e.g 400s take Jakob 62-64 seconds, but they were taking me 80-84 seconds, so I did 40 seconds rest rather than 30 to line up with a 2:1 work to rest ratio) and used the HR figure as a barrier to stay below (rather than lactate). I also wasn't doing their \"X-Factor\" workout; just 2 double threshold workouts a week and every few weeks I'd do a cross country race (7-9k) in place of one of the Double T days. I saw immediate improvements once again, taking my 10k from 34:47 down to 33:19 after just 12 double threshold days (in 9 weeks) and my 3k from 9:28 down to 9:16. I then got sick and picked up a nagging calf problem from that 3k race, and so I lost a bit of form. I was also trying to \"peak\" during track season, so I was trying to include a VO2 Max session each week rather than trying to accumulate more and more threshold running, which in hindsight, seems like a mistake. Anyway, I scrounged out some more improvement in the 5k, going from 16:28 down to 16:08 in January, but wasn't satisfied at missing sub-16. I've since been running more Double Threshold, but have still felt the need for the odd VO2 Max workout (every few weeks). However, after reading Sirpoc's posts and other testimonials, I'm sold on the idea of ditching VO2 Max completely, and trying the Norwegian Singles Approach rather than Double Threshold as I've been doing. The reason being, it appears that I could achieve more time at an intensity closer to LT2 using this method. For instance, I'm usually getting around 15.5k of LT1 running and only 14ks of LT2 work in each week. I tend to do my LT1 workouts at around 3:50-4:00/km, whereas the slowest time I'm prescribed on the Norwegian Singles Calculator is for 3 x 3k at 3:34-3:44/km. It seems like I'd be getting in 24ks (at first, but with the prospect of building to more) of a higher quality, rather than 29.5ks of a mixture of LT1 and LT2. The way I do LT2 basically lines up with what you guys are defining as Sub-T also e.g a typical evening workout might be 7 x 1k at 3:30/km off 60\" recovery. Anyway, a very long post, but I'm wondering what others would recommend?",

Workout volume is best scaled to be about 10% of your total weekly mileage. So 40 miles per week would mean 4 miles of intervals. You would have to calculate that on your own, can't give any example workouts at all, since you didn't provide us with any paces. But anything like 8x3 minute if that works to around 4 miles for you, or 4x6 minute, or etc. If you are fast enough you can run intervals on the track like 400m, 1k, 1600m, 2k, 3k, 3200m, but then you'd have to be doing close to 1min for 400s, 3min for ks, 6min for mile, 7min for 2k, and 11-12min for 3k for the times to work.",

    "msg": "Hopefully this post doesn't embarrass \"sirpoc\" too much. I say that, mainly because he's a really down to earth and humble guy. My story is I am mid 30s. An OK runner and have been running track and the road for around 8 years. I have been obsessed with a long term goal for a long time, of breaking 18! Hey, I know some of you guys will be like breaking 18 is chump change! But for me it seemed like a hurdle I could not overcome. Anyway, the meat of the story is I get talking to this guy at my local track. I saw him often and he seemed to not really be killing himself during this track time and yet me and my buddies are out on the floor, spread across the track after 6*1k. 7*800. You get the idea. Then this guy is still going but clearly not all out. Also, on my \"easy\" runs I'm overtaking him if I see him out on his easy days. It didn't add up. I saw him at a race and asked him what this secret was as he was crushing me and others I knew all last summer and leading into this year. He was quite helpful when we had ended up leaving around the same time after one session and I asked a few questions. He said about how he just does 3 sub threshold runs a week and that was it plus easy. I was skeptical but he insisted that was it. I googled it and found quite a lot of information but mostly just used a lot of what he told me. He offered to give me some basic plans and we exchanged details. The guy kindly send me weekly plans off his own back, he had no need to. All he said is I will owe him a beer one day and that I would easily break 18 and was happy to help. Anyway, let's get to the good part! Firstly, after around 9 months of this I broke 18 finally! And 17 ! I ran 16:54 this weekend just gone. For a while I kept the coach I was paying at the track but he told me this plan was crazy and I was going to fail. So we parted ways. My instincts told me this guy who offered to help would get me there. No idea why. Now, the funny thing? The guy turned out to be sirpoc! I literally never put 2 and 2 together until last week and the 10k he ran. He never once told me he was basically THE guy, effectively the person who laid out the whole NSM you will find here, Strava, reddit. Or the sirpoc method. Or whatever this is. I just find that really sums the guy up. Anyway, I would just like to thank him again and who knows, maybe this will help one other person have the confidence to sticking to the plan. The not running near race pace was the thing that spooked me the most. Especially as with my group of running friends I was the only one who really went with this. My main takeaway is I feel fresher to put the work in. The sessions and easy paces my coach had me doing were really holding me back I think. So tired. 75-80% HR on \"easy\" runs was nuts looking back and that coupled with how hard workouts were, always felt drained and once a month he was having me have a down week to recover. Maybe more so after a key race. This is that boom and bust cycle we keep seeing people talk about I guess. Now I truly feel like I can run everyday and things are under control and I can build load. My race at the weekend was strange. I knew I was going very well as my paces obviously were much higher in training. But I was turly taken back at how easy 3:28/km felt for the first K. As I hadn't ran anything near that, so I was nervous. But I finished strong with a 3:21 KM and that was it. My adult lifetime goal blitzed through. I hadn't run a 5k in 9 months, but I did run a low ish 35 10k the week before in the race sirpoc was i, so I knew this was possible if I held it together and paced it well. So wasn't a total shock, but to break 17 is almost a lifetime running achievement ticked off! Anyway, sirpoc , next time you are at the track, there will be a full crate of beer waiting with your name on it! Good luck in London pal!",
