If disco and bell bottom jeans are the vibe… David Costill, Jack Daniels, et al. have a 1976 study where they sampled higher level athletes from a variety of disciplines. I’ll speak specifically to the male data in the study, sprinters (100m) had a mean SDH of 12.9 and 24% area ST fibers, mid-distance runners (800m) had mean SDH of 14.8 and 47% area ST fibers, and distance runners (5000m+) had a mean SDH of 16.6 and 62% area ST fibers. For reference, the untrained subjects in their study had an SDH of 7.4 and 56% area ST fibers. So, saying the study you linked resulted in the participants reaching near elite runner status, seems a misrepresentation of elite. Or to draw from one of your earlier comments, it would be akin to equating a sport scientist to an exercise physiologist. Regardless, for every 6 person study that exists to draw overarching conclusions in exercise physiology, there is usually an equally underrepresented population sample to show the opposite, or at least question the aesthetic sense of anyone who thinks 1970’s avocado green paired with floral patterns should remain the preferred kitchen design of the 2020’s… David Bishop has research that shows mitochondrial content (i.e. volume) may be more influenced by duration, where as mitochondrial function (i.e. respiratory capacity) may be more influenced by intensity. And that inferring increases in mitochondrial function from increases in certain mitochondrial enzyme activity, may not be as valid as previously thought. I think the aforementioned is what John Whelan had in mind when suggesting a longer run still has a place in the training plan. P.S.

    "msg": "I'm going to reiterate one final time the main aspect of my original point that you continue to not address, then will stop. You vs Lexel is a much more entertaining matchup and I don't want to distract from that anymore, and my apologizes to both you and Lexel for the accusation that you are the same person. If the the cell metabolism is shifted at lower intensities, why wouldn't the training signals at this level be shifted as well? Why wouldn't there be unique benefits to these different signals, particularly with how they pertain to general health and the ability to adapt to training in general? If nothing else I would think there would be some specific benefit of working at lower intensity for developing the capacity to transport fatty acyl-CoA into the mitochondria. More access to fat metabolism should provide more energy for training and recovery. Even if any \"uniqueness\" of benefit is purely due to volume/duration isn't that practically the same because the volume/duration is only achievable with lower intensity? I'm under the impression that we still don't have a super clear concept about if and what different stimuli increase the surface area of mitochondria vs the enzymes in them, but that long and easy has been shown to be good for expanding that surface area, while shorter and harder is best for increasing the enzymes. It obviously was a mistake to have worded my original point as a statement rather than the question/hypothesis that it really is, but I'll stand by that it's a reasonable concept. If it's not a reasonable concept certainly someone as knowledgable as yourself would have a much easier time explaining why not. Gollnick et al. aren't really concerned about fat metabolism in that study or anything related to metabolic flexibility. They're just looking at fiber types, glycogen, aerobic capacity vis SDH, and anaerobic capacity using PFK. SDH activity is obviously important for metabolic flexibility, but since it's a few steps downstream of where the fuel is coming into the TCA cycle it doesn't seem like a good enough proxy to me. They also don't measure mitochondria volume. When it comes to SDH they explain that they made deliberate choices to try to get the biggest effect on SDH activity -the VL muscle and an activity (cycling) that demands extensive use of this muscle. They explain that the SDH activity in the subjects is greater than what they measured in runners because cycling demands more from the VL, yet the VO2max/kg is still greater with the runners -to me this seems like they're saying it was deliberately meant to just be a small snapshot of whats going so that they could get a very large effect. It's proof of concept demonstration, but nowhere a full measure of whats going on in the mitochondria or any sort of sport-specific metabolic output. I feel you are exaggerating what this demonstrates, particularly in a comparison to runners, when the authors themselves seem to say that isn't a fair comparison. With this I of course do have to eat some sci-hub crow -I probably don't have higher SDH activity in my VL muscle than the participants in the study. I seem to be in alight company there, as from another Gollnick study we can see that Dan Murphy (4th at 1971 NCAA XC) had a lower VL SDH than the average of those six guys at the end of their bike erg training. Like you said we should focus on performance rather than physiological responses. I know that LT1 and LT2 (or any other way to slice up intensities) are not really true physiological anchor points/events/whatever, but they are still useful estimates for how metabolism is changing in response to intensity.",

The measured activity of an enzyme is obviously dependent on numerous factors, e.g., the concentrations of substrates and co-factors, pH, temperature, etc. You therefore really can't compare absolute values across studies/laboratories as you have done - indeed, even within a laboratory there can be \"drift\" in the measurements over time, due to, e.g., different individuals preparing standards with vary technique/accuracy. (This is why we use NIST-traceable standards when measuring nitrate and nitrite concentrations via HPLC.) Because of the above, you should really only compare relative values/changes. In that regard, even the distance runners in Costill et al.'s classic study had an SDH activity only slightly more than twice that of the untrained controls, similar to the magnitude of the increase observed in Gollnick's study. This, despite large differences in training volume and, of course, genetics (including fiber type differences).

Re. intensity: the first thing that you have to realize is that the word doesn't mean much at the level of an individual motor units/single muscle fiber. That is, by and large that motor unit is either recruited and those muscle fibers are activated, or they aren't. (Obviously rate-coding can layered on top of this, although that is a motor control strategy that seems to reserved for only short bursts of activity, not sustained exercise.) Furthermore, since the primary signals driving the muscular adaptations to training (i.e., cellular energetics, calcium, and *perhaps* glycogen availability) are all intracellular, a given muscle fiber really doesn't know or care what its neighbors are doing, or what the humoral/hormonal milleu might be). If this were *not* true, then you would find adaptations in muscle fibers/motor units and even muscles not engaged in the exercise - yet you don't, i.e., the adaptations are local. Furthermore, you can eliminate the influence of hormones using surgical approaches, drugs to block receptors, etc., yet the muscle still adapts as expected. As for fat metabolism, it is a red herring. That is, you don't have to oxidize fat to get better at oxidizing fat, and increased rates of fat oxidation are not responsible for the training induced increase in muscle mitochondria. Finally , the whole \"train long for mitochondrial quantity, train hard for mitochondrial quality\" idea is belief by the dynamic nature of the mitochondrial reticulum, as I described previously.",

But either way, I definitely PRd with quite some margin) -I’m 38, running for a bit over a year now while having a 10 hour job and a 18 month old daughter. -running got really important for me but obviously ranked behind family and work which I need to feed my family 😂 -the 2 PRs had 5 months inbetween, I don’t know if that’s good or bad, just a fact -it took some months to really feel the improvements where I also feel like I made a huge jump last 4 weeks out of nowhere (stuff like easy pace going down 20 seconds at same hr <70% within what felt like from one day to another) So my thoughts are not about a random PR where most will laugh about the time, it’s more about a method which is suitable for time limited people like me who still want to be in shape and get their „best bang for the buck“ (it’s not like I wouldn’t care about progress, I really do care but only vs myself) I just can say that I’m able to run 7 days a week (I do the exact plan laid out on page 1) with around 75-90km a week without needing a single rest day last 6 months cause of being tired. The only times i made a break was illness. I also didn’t have any injury. Another great thing for me is that I don’t need to think about what I „need“ to do the next day or if I’m able to hit my peak workout paces that day. I just put my 3 pre set workouts (10*3min, 5*6min, or 3*10min) on my watch and press start. With a lot of stuff around running I’m also not in the same shape every day (sometimes 5 hours of sleep-sometimes 8, sometimes bad hydrated and whatever else life brings) so I obviously have days where my paces feel super easy and others where it doesn’t. But on all days it’s „easy“ enough that I’m recovered enough to go again 2 days later. (1 misconception is often that it’s super easy, it’s still work to do 3 times a week) That also leads to not overthinking things like I would tend to do (hitting a bad workout which was a „key one“ would make me overthink it, with this method I’m also not happy if I had a bad one but I just go again 2 days later) Long story short: i know that my personal progress can have different reasons (especially with only running for that short time) ,but I’ve learned that consistency is probably one of the main things to get better at running. This method allows me to be as consistent as I probably could be (1.500km as per today for the year) without burning out or being injured. This thread and especially the community on Strava helped me tremendously understanding a bit more what I do(sub 2:40 marathoners and sub 16 5k guys take time out of their day to help random Internet guys like me getting better) I didn’t wanted to interrupt the conversation about different studies, stuff I don’t know any about or don’t want to follow exactly, but maybe I was able to help a person like me (hobby jogger who didn’t knew what to do exactly) to give this method a go. shoutout to all the legends in this thread like sirpoc, hard2find, shirtboy, jiggy etc (I forgot names of some more guys so sorry for that) to help out other people like me with their enormous knowledge for free!!!",

Hopefully you continue to progress I will look out for your progress myself. Would be cool to match up guys who post on here on Strava. Probably easier to do register on Strava with real names there you cannot hide and match up to our username we sometimes post under. I think that is why Strava group is better now, if you be an a**hole you cannot at least hide behind username. Of course, I think Hard2find make me laugh. He is the easiest to find as he just use his username. Maybe it would be a cool post for someone to do on Strava board where we all real, I would be very curious who is who.
