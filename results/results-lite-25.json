  {
    "msg": "The confusion is from people not using a universal system. Since we are of significantly different capabilities, especially when we look at world class athletes too, the comparisons to race times fall apart. The more important metric is what paces you can hold for certain durations like 30mins (CV pace), 60mins, etc. Like look at HM pace. For a world class runner that’s very close to a 60min race. So their HM pace is the pace they can hold for 60mins. If you run a 90+ min HM, then your HM pace is a significantly different intensity and will have a significantly different effect when you train at that pace. When people here are putting workout paces in terms of race paces, it’s inevitably individualized, not a flawless universal recommendation. Similarly, if you measure the intervals by distance rather than duration, then you are running much longer intervals than the elites. A 400m rep can end up being nearly 2mins long for a runner in this thread, whereas Jakob is running it in just over a minute. You’d be nearly doubling the volume of the workout by going by distance rather than duration. As a starting point I prefer converting everything to duration and completely forgetting about distance. So think about what pace you can hold if you go all out for 30mins, for 60mins, or for 120mins. And for the workouts, measure intervals by time, not distance, so 25 x 1min instead of 25 x 400m. I personally do: 10 x 3min (1min rest) @ 60min pace 5 x 6min (1min rest) @ 120min pace 25 x 1min (30s rest) @ 30min pace And I sometimes do continuous marathon tempos integrated into a long run (a notch slower than the 6min reps) for some race specific work. But it’s not like I’ve run time trials and really know what those paces are, so in the end I am looking at race paces and estimating a pace a bit faster or slower than them. The approximations you’ve written (like doing 1600’s at 10mi pace) are accomplishing the same thing if they’re done appropriately for your race times. So that gets you closer to doing known effective workouts. Now I personally only do two of these a week. Whereas Jakob can do 4 as well as another race specific day of work like hills at mile pace or whatever he does. I’m hoping over time I can increase workout frequency and/or volume, but until my fitness plateaus it’s not a priority. The only thing I need to be careful of is increasing the paces of the workouts too much and making them too intense. I’d rather increase mileage or increase workout frequency than change the nature of the workouts. IMO a number of people are doing their reps too long and too slow (because they’re copying elites but they’re copying distance instead of duration and they’re copying paces in terms of race distance rather than race duration), but if they’re happy and they’re improving, good for them.",

I think people are also forgetting the clear advice given that 1. There is no threshold pace here, we are just looking to create the state of threshold and 2. Still the vast majority of your running is going to be easy 75/25 split. Sirpoc last week for example ran only 22% by my calculation of his weekly minutes at sub threshold according to strava. The rest was very, very easy for his level, just look at the very low heart rate, hugely under the 70% cap he mentioned.

One thing I learned the hard way, was the easy runs really you should listen to this 70% max HR guide. I go by feel, what feels easy to me actually isn't. The first few months 76-78% max HR really caught up with me. As soon as I checked my ego in and went slower, I started to really progress. If you look at sirpoc easy runs, aside from after that usual 10-15 mins everyone gets where your body starts working, there's almost no cardiac drift. Even by the end of an hour or 90 mins run. It's quite remarkable. Easy really should mean easy. If you look at what Seiler says, despite his limitations, basically if you are truly below LT1 you should see a pretty flat HR plot after the first 10 mins. I asked sirpoc this direct on Strava, he says still even to this day he will very slowly run or even walk up any steep inclines he encounters. If that is good enough for a 15 min master 5ker then I can certainly check my ego at door and do the same. Obviously with my experience I am slow, but just used the paces sirpoc mentioned but did as suggested, moved them from distance to time. Tbh, maybe I won't even get to 3k repeats but the 12 minutes mentioned by sirpoc instead will work just fine. As do the 3min repeats instead of 1k. I am improving massively, that's all that matters. Also, to the guy who made the pod. Very nice. Nothing wrong with that at all. Honestly, there's other places you could take it and if you could convince sirpoc himself the actual first hand background and story of him and his success is incredibly interesting, that's totally aside from the fact of all the interest he's shown in the what works, doesn't work etc of all this.",

That's highly individual. What you both propose, along with Sirpoc, is basically just how to get started and help most people on average. But I don't care about the average--I care about me! It makes no difference to me if your system on average is better than Sirpoc's. Consistency, I've thought about going based on 60 min or 90min pace as well rather than distance PRs. The interesting thing is that if you are right most people would be undershooting their lactate values at the end of sessions (unless they're faster than sirpoc). But the opposite ends up happening; Sirpoc's paces are too fast for most. This is a case where works on average doesn't have much utility. Everyone just has to start, be consistent with how they monitor and make intelligent adjustments.

Obviously knowing your whole lactate curve is best and testing. But I have had great success with the paces from page 1 without being tweak much. At first I was very much on slower end. Now I am actually sometimes faster than sirpoc guide pace on short repeat. I think he says it's just a guide to go as starting point. That is very much how I interpret it and tweak paces for individual. What I would never tweak is two factor. 3x sub threshold a week and 4x easy runs. This formula just seems standard and I also play around stupidly as others so at other points and it just creates unbalance. I have now manage 29 straight weeks basic as this. OK, so I not as fast as sirpoc and will never be. But I have knocked 3 minutes off my 5k PB. Hey, it makes me seem superstar now at my local races to my friends, so I am happy 😊 My took is primitive and I have made very big progress as note. All I did was the friel field LTHR test and simple to make sure I do not go over LTHR value end of workout or especially during.

I look back now and feel idiot for destroying myself doing those 6-8*800 track workouts and equivalents. I work in the science field in my career path and whilst I like to want answers in field I work in, all I care about here is being faster running. I just don't see how anything lexel propose can help make anything better. If you have your 5k pace recent and Lthr you confident with, it almost plug and play. Maybe after 2-3 sessions you realise paces might be not quite for you, but it's a decent wide range. Then off go. I don't see how converting anything or everything into % of CV/CS going to improve anything. That what we are trying to do here, right?

I asked him how he does it and he simply said run slow and check your watch lol sounds simple. I think we overlook how disciplined he is. I think that is truly part of the success. Maybe being a slave to the metrics is truly the best way for best results? Hard for some of us to get heads round as experienced runners. His pace can vary a bit / got faster as he's got faster. But that HR average is always below that 70% mark mentioned, as we know and have seen his max HR somewhere in the low to mid 190s. So 125-33 average what we see for him is truly easy. Remember, it's not about pace. Your body does not have a measuring guage in it. It has no idea how far you run. Just knows how long and for what effort.

I was a multi eventer back in my university days and definitely on the faster twitcher side (jumping events were my strongest point, nowadays my legs are still twice the size of most on the start line for distance races), in my older age (nearly 40), the past couple of years I've been trying to convert to distance (now 36min 10k PB - hobby jogger territory but improving). I've tried the sub threshold method for a couple of months last fall but found it more draining than it should (compared to traditional training weeks, ie one faster interval session, one tempo) and was going backwards whilst also dealing with niggles so gave up. Didn't really match many people's experience here. I wonder if this could be the reason, ie need to slow it down far more than specified by the spreadsheets. I was always conservative, but perhaps not enough. For a faster twitch athlete should the easy/long runs be slower too? I guess sub 70% HR max is already very slow (8 min mile) though so maybe not. I guess lactate testing would probably be the only way of truly finding out for the ST intervals. Keen to give it another go but hesitant after the last attempt. Thanks for bringing up the muscle fibre type point, one of my training partners who is definitely slow twitch has really thrived with a SubT approach using the same pace guide, whilst I struggled.

Tempted to consider trying something of a hybrid approach though as long continuous efforts definitely hurt me more than they should (eg feel better after a short/fast session than say a 8 mile upper Z2). I think a point of confusion for me is whether fast twitch athletes should play to their strengths by going faster/shorter and recruiting more FT fibres, or doing subT even slower to strengthen weaknesses (more ST). Probably depends on race target, 5-10k is my preference. I'm absolutely not a physiologist and stabbing blindly in the dark.

    "msg": "Hi all, I’ve really enjoyed this thread, it’s made me think at length about the approach I’ve had to training over the decades. Before we even get to the details of lactate etc, the idea of doing sessions at non-maximal intensity is a novel one for me. I wish I’d known about it in my 20s! It’s early days (I’ve been doing this style of training for just under two months) but it’s interesting that I ran a slight “old man” PB (I’m in my late 40s) in the 16:40s on the weekend, vs my previous of just under 17min. I’m currently doing about 80km/week (50mi/week), which is more than I’ve done for a few decades and keeping in mind it’s winter here in Australia. So perhaps it’s also possible my 5k result came from increased mileage. But of significance is that at no point during the last two months have I run to the point of being a crumpled heap at the end of a session – something that was unthinkable in my previous approach to training, at any mileage. I’d collapse 2-3 times a week previously after a session of hard intervals. Now, two questions I have, which I don’t think have been covered (I read the first 60 pages of this thread before it sort of degenerated, but I’ve been keeping up again since about p125): We all know Jakob is a handy 1500m runner, but most on this thread seem to be longer distance specialists. For me, 5k is as long as I race seriously and my main interest is the 1500m, probably more closely followed by 800m but then I enjoy the 3k/5k a lot too. Perhaps you can get away with training like this for 1500, just, but it’s hard to imagine it being good for the 800m? Or perhaps it is a good way to build base during the winter, then switch to (or include) more traditional lactic tolerance type training come summer. But has anyone here applied this as a middle distance runner? Secondly… what about this as a method for kids? I have seen some say that part of the strategy with this approach is high overall mileage. I have a daughter in her early teens, also focused on middle distance running. We’re doing a few of these longer, low-intensity type sessions which she’s handling well. But her total mileage is maybe 30km/ week (about 20mi/week). I’m reluctant to dial total weekly volume up for a young athlete… is the Norwegian approach therefore one that should wait a few years? We don’t have a lactate meter, and I’m still relying on some ‘gut feel’ for intensity (I haven’t even done a Friels test yet) but, we both seem to be recovering well from the sessions. I am to do my easy runs at around 130bpm and long intervals maxing out at 160bpm. I suspect my max is around 180bpm (but don't know - haven't been wearing the HR strap all that long).

First few pages seemed interesting and I've had it pinned to my taskbar ever since. I was already doing 5-6 days a week and 5+ hours , so I thought this method might work for me. Upped it to 7 and followed the normal schedule. Firstly, the paces were way too fast. Which I had suspected being A) slow and B) good knowledge of my fibre make up. In fact, I had to go super slow to make it work loosely using HR as a guide. I would say that maybe 10-12 weeks I felt terrible. Truly awful. In fact I was just about to give up because I just felt this wasn't made for me and back to shorter, harder stuff. But then I entered a 5k purely for fun to run with my wife and I actually PB'd by a good 30 seconds. From maybe a week or so after that, my body felt like it had changed. The grind feeling was gone and I could run the paces on the lower end of the spreadsheet someone shared on Strava. Now, another 3-4 months on and a bigger drop of my PB - sub 19, I can run actually nearer the faster end of thr guide paces. But took me a long, long time to get there. Whereas, seems like the real slow twitch runners, got there either straight away or adapted in a much shorter space of time. My case study of one? Don't give up. I was pure speed and nothing else and as far away from a middle to long distance runner as you can get. Anyway, just my thoughts guys, hope it might provide some hope ot context to some.",

I wonder if since I’m in the offseason, this is when I work on that aerobic weakness, or am I doomed to always be lagging on the long runs with the team but dominate the 200m repeats, as has happened this track season?

For them I think this is a reasonable alteration - but for 1500m type runners I think it might be unnecessary. The original Ingebrigtsen training seems to concentrate on 400m 1k and 2k reps and nothing longer. That's what 1500m specialists should do IMO. I also don't see a huge utility in long runs for 1500m runners. There was someone on the strava thread who said he never did ANY runs longer than 1600m and PR'd his HM time. I also question the emphasis on so much Easy mileage - if the entire point of easy days is to recover - it matters not how many of those miles you do - perhaps it is only necessary to do some minimum mileage as just a way to make sure your body MOVES on those days and flushes all the waste products from your system. I don't know. But it seems to me the THRESHOLD runs are the 95% training and all the other stuff - long runs, easy days, hills etc - those are last 5% training. One last thing - using distance for the threshold reps I think is a mistake - CTL and other type measurements are a version of something weight lifters have known and used for decades - you improve your hypertrophy and strength based on Time Under Tension. 5 slow reps can beat 10 fast ones because the TIME the muscle is being subjected to stress is greater. I think thresholds are the same - you don't target 10x1k or 25x400m - instead you target the hours per week. Look at 10x1k for Jakob versus 10x1k for a hobby jogger like me - a session like that is 50+ minutes for me - it might be HALF that time for Jakob. And since all these reps vary little in pace ( a few seconds per k faster or slower depending on the distance of the rep) - in the end all that matters is the TIME you spend doing threshold reps during any given week. And the distance of any specific rep might be mostly irrelevant. As u get faster u naturally end up doing more threshold mileage even while keeping the total time the same.

I struggle with this myself. When i start feeling good I always fall for the false choice of speeding up the easy days. Never fails. But it always fails me.

Says that FT respond better to 5k/10k pace work than LT pace. Anaerobic work - FT can handle more, long rests between intervals, however cautions about doing too much anaerobic volume if you're targeting 5k/10k+ to avoid inhibiting your aerobic capacity.

LITERALLY NOBODY is dumb enough to do this. Surely. Please. Please tell me I'm wrong or I have no hope for humanity intelligence.",

    "msg": "Actionable? Somewhat. For someone in a hotter climate, especially as the seasons change from hot to cold and cold to hot. If a guy does a \"standard\" workout at a familiar pace and notices higher/lower decoupling, it helps to calibrate how much to adjust. I agree that it's mostly a \"confirmative,\" post-run metric, but I find it helpful. The guy I was responding to has been quite concerned about getting paces right. (relatively less-experienced runner?)has been experimenting and trying to figure out how easy his easy pace ought to be. He can come back from an easy run thinking it was easy... check his aerobic decoupling... see that it was too high (or just right or whatever)... and then It might be actionable in this way for someone who doesn't have experience with what \"easy\" is supposed to feel like.",

Not quite an encumbered as a lot of us wear with 'this is how you get fast' or 'this is the formula to use'. Coming from cycling i think is a huge help because cycling is relentlessly focused on what works in the endurance world and also not to turn it into some sort of secret sauce.",

    "msg": "My top end speed and pop has declined with age naturally, it's the first thing to go. I used to race a pretty decent 200/400 and it's the same with most of the guys I used to race with, past 35 that goes south damn quick. I kind of like this long distance stuff, the longevity is there! I can still probably run a decent 400 in an age group race though. It's maybe there at the end of a 5k now I'm aerobically half decent as well. But I don't think speed or sprint exists in the way people think it does? Unless I have the aerobic engine there's no real way to use it. It's more like who is just slowing down less rather than sprinting at the level I race 5ks. I am glad to see my post got some good feedback. Hope it genuinely gives some help. Because it probably did take me twice as long as most people seem to mention to get the results , being so fast twitch, but in the end, we got there. I am still improving and I am almost only using what sirpoc has been using. Shamelessly copying his schedule from Strava, but with not quite as much time but the caveat of that I am aiming for the same amount of time spent sub threshold. So that's nothing apart from the 3 sessions a week. So I do think it can work across the spectrum, as by the looks of things and from what people have said I couldn't be more fast twitch and him more slow twitch. I think patience is the key to all of this. The whole thread in fact. It's not going to create the miracle pill the internet wants, but it'll slowly get you there. But this is not for the ones who want results in 6-8 weeks even. Probably, even slower if your muscle fibers are more like mine. But hopefully hope that we can all get there in the end. Please bare in mind I am very very slow compared to some of you guys who I'm in awe of. I was happy to break 20 if I ever break 19 I think it'll be a miracle.",

    "msg": "I think you have hit the nail firmly on the head. Great post. Being an outsider sirpoc has the massive advantage of not coming through school, college etc as a runner. Most of us are corrupted by it, stuff engrained into us that just does not make any logical sense to outsiders, especially from other sports maybe the curve. People still think running is somehow special to all the rest of the endurance sports. Okay, maybe we have to be a little bit more careful with the impact on our bodies. But inherently, the same things and focuses get you towards you as close to your peak and where you might want to maybe thinking to start icing the cake, as they do in other sports. But with coaches shouting from the rooftops, this is how it's meant to be done, run 5k repeats damnit!!! I've been guilty of it in my time as well. Coming from the outside he has been able to look and simply think 'how can I maximise the talent I have to the limitations of time I have?' not caring one bit really what anyone else thinks. That there is no speed work, not 5k pace work, no hils, no repeats. Because you look at it from how cyclists look at it....'how can I maximise performance?' look at how cycling has changed in the last 10-15 years. Imagine telling cycling coaches 25 years ago that they would be training like they are training now. They wouldn't believe it. I think that's what those of us with all these years of running struggle with in this thread. Making the same mistakes even though we know we are probably wrong, or at least not maximising what we could be still, even to this point.",
