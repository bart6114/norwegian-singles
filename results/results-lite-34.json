Almost the new hobby joggers training bible. If there was anyone who has been running maybe 6-18 months who wanted to know where to go next, this is the place. But what I find really interesting, are the posters here or the guys on Strava who have been running years who have copied or applied a version of this to themselves and then still improved. That's what takes things from just useful, to remarkable. What is interesting with regards to sirpoc and what he's doing now, is how he's still managing to find ways to increase load. I'm guessing he's still increasing his CTL and he just did a pretty decent 5k PR, which shows me that you can still even progress with this if you put your mind to it, even when you get to a very high level and keeping the principles the same, but just finding that time or room to train that little bit more.

It is recommended to have at least 3 better 4 time-trials. However, some studies show that also 2 TTs gave a good result (2 TTs at the edge of the hyperbolic function, short-long). In my %CV thread, i presented a CV estimation based only on a 5k result, based on IAAF score tables, which seems to work well too. As we train here below (sub) CV, we do not need W’/D’ (in this 2-paramter approach). (this parameter has indeed problems) I mentioned the 4th performance parameter, which is durability (additional to LT%, VO2max, CR). Any VT/LT/CV 'threshold' shall not be seen as a constant parameter, it is a variable. CV as well as LT2 goes down it we get tired (i provided some papers here in the past) . And there are day to day variations. Intensities above CV seems to increase recovery time significant. Therefore, to stay ‘safely’ below CV, you need some kind of safety gap below CV. This gap is individual, but 95%CV is a good starting point (for the method mentioned herein). The big advantage of CV is, that you do not need neither a step graded lactate testing, where you have to select between 20+ methods to estimate LT2, nor a spiroergometry. A spiroergometry is still considered the gold standard as you know, but it is quite expensive and complex. Also measurement tolerance is there. However, a spiroergometry is the only way to measure VO2max and CR, so it has its value. CV is available for the broad mass, without any complex measurements and devices, that gives a big plus for it. It also provides the possibility to rank athletes based on CV for a HS or whatever, as it is a great performance index.",

So since two weeks I run all my workouts just a little bit faster, more like August 5km pace + 10-20 seconds. The workouts are surpisingly as doable as with the slightly slower pace and also the days inbetween feeling the same. I had a couple of good parkruns (not run all-out, so not sure about race pace) now as well. Will continue now with the new paces. That feels just very good now.

To be clear, I don't think anybody's sure of exactly what causes running injury, but the fatigue model makes sense to me: your stabilizer muscles get tired/big muscles get lazy and then you start moving in suboptimal ways.

This gives you an additional benefit over just the benefit in terms of time spent with LT at 2-4mmol. In very long intervals your form is much more likely to suffer negating these benefits, and probably increasing increasing injury risk as stabiliser muscles etc fatigue.

Then it all started flowing and after 8 months I'm in lifetime shape and still gaining at 43 years old. That seems to be the pattern, give or take , for a lot of people. It takes a lot of guts or courage I guess to absolutely go all in with this method when you don't see that initial gain. I've suspected it's because using let's say a textbook Daniel's plan, you can overload and get quite good gains. But likely you will need a break after a block and some decent downtime. Whereas this is more linear, you just build and build and build. So you can grow fitness at a slow rate in comparison, but when you scale it up to 50 weeks instead of like 10 with a traditional plan, suddenly you have a huge amount more training load stored in the bank with never needing a rest, taper etc. I don't think it's much more complicated than that, going on how some of the much smarter guys than me on here or Strava have tried to explain it.",

They seem to be suggesting the variance in an individuals decay from their max steady-state speed (so whether CS, MLSS, etc.) should be added to the Joyner Model? However, what I don’t quite understand is 1) why the Joyner model is the reference point and 2) the linear decay you reference (btw, I assume you’re talking about how it appears on a semi-log plot where the decay is modeled logarithmically and the decay factor is about -0.06 +/-, right?) in a more robust model, seems to already be capturing what they are referring to as physiological resilience, no? 2. Assuming what I said in point 1 is a fair representation of the process, one could improve their resilience/durability, without increasing their threshold simply by not falling off as much at the longer events, no? For instance, same threshold basis but seeing an improvement in half marathon and marathon. Jones seems to see that as resilience improving where as you’re saying that’s just realizing what you were physiologically capable of already, since there was no change in the model parameters other than the decay factor (that’s how I refer to the term in my approach but I think it’s stamina in training peaks)?

Consider the following: Assume you have two athletes with absolutely identical running speeds at maximal metabolic state. For athlete A, though, this speed is overestimated by 1%, whereas for athlete B it is underestimated by 1%, just due to normal measurement error/variability in testing. If you then threw them on the treadmill and asked them to run as long as possible at any speed slower than this, athlete B will be able to exercise about 15% longer, simply due to the way small differences in intensity translate into much larger differences in duration as a result of the shallow slope of this relationship in this region.

I’m still a bit unsure why they did this since there was no pre-defined data set they had to use and, presumably, they would know taking times from outside the “optimal” time range on the longer end (i.e. 10km and 15km race times) would lead to a slower CS?

Davis in particular had more running specific studies, along with some nice graphical representations of the data from the studies.

Seeing how one can observe a VO2 steady state in loads of MLSS test data, and those carry on for 30 minutes, I thought it curious that at marathon pace, you’d expect a decline in running economy so soon (assuming an even race pace)? Would it be more accurate to expect a delayed decay over the course of a marathon, where the decay doesn’t start until later in the race and then rises steadily to the end?

They also have to choose to ignore (or simply don't realize) that if CP is supposed to represent the intensity at which all ATP is produced aerobically, a steady state in whole body VO2 (even if delayed) is only a necessary but not a sufficient condition - whole body lactate (and high energy phosphate, but that's minor) content must also be constant as well. Thus, *by their very own definition*, CP and MLSS are exactly the same thing! This is why I say that they can only differ if one (or both) has been incorrectly operationalized. For folks new to the field, this probably all seems a bit confusing... aren't people like Jones and Poole \"big names\"? How could they be wrong?
