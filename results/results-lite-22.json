Adding also someone pages back mentioned as maybe the 800/1500 equivalent example and Hobbs recently detailed training on Coffee Club podcast. Doubles on all days for mileage and breaks threshold sessions. Found very interesting, as this similar to Justin Rinaldi basic training in Citius interview and many posts on boards, basics of 800 training could be just Speed Dev, Mile threshold reps, and hills. Still interested what pure threshold training like Sirpoc does could get for mid distance but seems like these frameworks of mixing T w/ hills and speed are most basic mid distance incorporations.

    "msg": "@ Blue Meenie and John Whelan Those were both thoughtful additions with what you added about TSS/CTL. I tried to steer away from analyzing sirpoc’s training (update: it’s clearly working for him) or redrafting the blueprint for implementing it, and it seems you’re both thinking in that direction too, refreshing! I’d agree that if you run the experiment where the control is just running easy and the alternative adds in 2-3 quality days, for the same number of hours per week, there would be around a 5% improvement in performance within 6-12 weeks. That would actually reflect my personal experience too. However, what specifically you do (tempo intervals vs continuous tempos vs fartlek), I think, is more a function of what you respond to, both physiologically and psychologically. So that’s where I was going when I said workouts matter but so too does the individual. Regarding the accuracy of TSS… there are very simple modifications you could make so that the formula is more accurate for runners, particularly for the range of paces that most people run their workouts. Again, if on the faster end, a score of, say, 90 isn’t even achievable because the duration required at the pace is not physically possible, but on the slower end it can be achieved with an easy to moderately paced longer run, that skews any analysis being done. I still think the system is useful though. Similar to how Jack Daniels uses a standardized running economy curve for VDOT, you could do the same with a lactate curve for assigning a stress score. A simple exponential, in my opinion, makes for a much improved equivalency across the pace spectrum of say 70% to 120% FTP. However, CTL is responsible for tracking the long term training load, and that seems to be the focus of this discussion. It doesn’t surprise me that one notices a fairly accurate linear relationship between their race performance and CTL (particularly when you train as consistently as sirpoc has). You can take ANY positively sloped function though, from linear, polynomial, power, or exponential to represent your stress score. When you run it through an exponentially weighted filter, which CTL is, you end up with the same shaped function. A positively increasing, but at a decaying rate, improvement curve over time. Add additional stimulus to your training and you’ll accrue more CTL. So, yes, it can be used as a predictor (time to update the calculator haha), but consider the accuracy of the input. I imagine the TSS/CTL approach is popular in the cycling community, because it’s simple and accurate enough. There are plenty of alternative models that exist and which are specifically meant to be performance predictors though. In fact, Andrew Coggan created TSS/CTL by simplifying a more nuanced performance prediction model (Banister Impulse -Response Model).",

Part of the problem here for running TSS/CTL is that most implementations (Runalyze, Intervals.icu, Garmin) default to using versions of heart rate based TRIMP. TRIMP (even trimp_exp) is an awful load measure because it's based on heart rate (which is a response to load, not load itself) and also way overweights very low intensity while not even being able to measure true high intensity (again, heart rate). Power in cycling doesn't have these issues. Honestly, this could be half the reason people like me have seen such drastic differences in fitness even at the same CTL.

I also agree power solves most if not all the problems to someone who is looking to get 99% of their potential. But , unfortunately, the Stryd sucks for me, as I've posted. I've sent Hard2find on a mission before to try work it out. But his conclusion, it also just won't work for me. I don't fit the algorithm when wind comes into play.

I used a ring stopwatch that worked well for times but the metronome works better - you can set it to beep every 3rd or 4th step or whatever in time with your footfalls and breathing.

For example, %LT (expressed as a % of VO2max in this case) and vLT not being correlated COULD mean that the runners with the lower %LT have stronger “anaerobic” systems despite having similar VO2max values. Alternatively, runners with a higher %LT could simply have weaker “anaerobic” systems, again, despite similar VO2max values. How that manifests in this study is the former will be reaching the arbitrarily defined LT at a lower %LT than the latter. This would actually fit into Alois Mader’s lactate threshold model, thus explaining why you see the lack of correlation between %LT and vLT. Test the correlation between %LT and Lactate Max though, and I’d suspect you’ll see a significant relationship. Of course, this is not my field, just something I toy with. Also, the equation you posted is basically just an algebraically rearranged economy curve, no? That's going to require that people go to a lab and get both lactate and oxygen consumption tested.

However, by collection of race results the same year as the physiological tests were performed, the range of performance was found to be from 8.05 to 13.30 min in 3000 m.” Seems reasonable then that the 1500m-5000m would fit the researchers definition of “long distance runners” and your definition of “highly aerobic events”? Great, so back to %LT and vLT… it’s not simply a shorter race distance I’m talking about, it’s the metabolic profile (meaning both VO2max and Lamax) and muscle fiber profile! Take two runners with the same VO2max but differing lactate max values. To get to the arbitrarily defined LT that this study proposed (baseline lactate plus a constant), the runner with the lower lactate max will be working at a higher percent of their VO2max thus faster relative vLT, than the runner with the higher lactate max. Since, for the runner with the higher lactate max, the intensity (% VO2max) doesn’t need to be as high to generate the arbitrary lactate value. Now, tying that in with the range of athletes in this study and based on the mathematical model of the lactate threshold that Alois Mader defined (which frames the process in terms of the underlying generative mechanism based on ATP, ADP, and AMP production), the variation seen in this study would be well explained, simply, by relatively small differences in Lamax. That would mean %LT and vLT are not actually independent from performance level, as you stated. Rather, vLT is not explained well by %VO2max alone. However, add Lamax to the mix, and both a relationship and explanation appears. This could be referred to as a eureka moment.",

His skill I think is communication and working out what works when applied to running versus cycling. This is someone who has had elite hobby jogger/ cyclist level in two sports now. The why is to other people scientifically. However, I don't think that needs be to ditract from guys like Coggan, unbelief, Hard2find really drilling down. I think most people probably can get their heads round what they are saying. If not, it's interesting to learn, as you point out. If you don't have a taste for that, again as someone else mentioned.
