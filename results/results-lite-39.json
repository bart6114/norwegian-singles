ST runners will benefit too obviously & they could likely afford to run closer to threshold for workouts. If FT are careful & keep it at Sub T (or a little slower) & keep their easy runs truly easy, I could see them really flourishing with this training. As my fitness has improved as a FT runner I've decreased recovery time from 60 sec to 45 sec instead of increasing pace. I do that for a couple weeks then cautiously go back to 60 sec recoveries with increased paces for the Sub T workouts. Similar to the method Hadd training used for FT runners.

But the Garmin wrist power is a mess and in the wind and the stryd doesn't make any sense. I can run in the wind and it'll give me 20-30w more for say a 10 min block because of how it overestimates power into the wind on the track (depite basically a total even effort). Nobody wants power to work probably more than me, but it's just too much of a headache for me to care about at this point. It doesn't measure force. Until it does, it's just an algorithm really that is guesstimating a lot of things. If you run on a treadmill or in completely controlled conditions, it might work way better. I've never run on a treadmill in my life, so can't comment. I think a big issue is how windy it is where I am right on the sea and flat open spaces. The stryd really is comical with some of the stuff it comes up with. In the early days I played around a lot with going right up to LT2 (if it exists, there's one to apart some debate lol) and beyond, testing on the meter to see what I could get away with. I spent a good number of weeks and months playing around with all combos before I settled on the amount of lactate I could generate and the pace proxys in place to replicate that (roughly) - and then feel OK to go again in 48 hours. None of this was done on a whim and a prayer, it was carefully planned out. But the big note, I only intended this for myself. I didn't intend, at any point to it blow up like this. Having said that, whilst some people have had to tweak things or start off with the paces slower, it's actually held up very well as a general one size fits all approach (obviously it's impossible to have a blanket approach for everyone). There's obviously a million ways to train. There might be a better one on 7 days a week and only an hour or so to dedicate to training in a day. But if there is, i'm yet to have tried it. I'm absolutely not the guardian of this system, despite what the internet seems to think. If there is another or better way to train and someone could show me that, I'll jump all over for it. After all I basically just stole this idea from my own training in another life as a cyclist, of which I just stole from others.

I do it based on time at pace, not volume, and not including the rests even if they’re jogged. I‘m a bit confused by your focus on very short intervals. Because they’re so short, your margin of error for pacing correctly becomes razor thin… and your HR data suggests to me you’re erring here. Your avg HR on your rests should be noticeably lower than your ON intervals! Instead it’s effectively the same or even higher. For comparison, when I do 1km repeats with 60 sec jogging rest, I’ll still see an avg >=10bpm lower, and my HR will come down to ~70% MHR before the next interval starts. You might be eliciting a sub-threshold state on these workouts, but the design makes me think more of tightly controlled fartlek and I suspect your lactate levels are bouncing and rising throughout. It’s sustainable at the moment because you’re not doing very much quality volume — just under 10% of total weekly volume (36min of 375min). That’s just not very much stimulus. I‘m not suggesting jumping into 20-25% of your total volume right away, but I think you will really benefit more from longer intervals and larger workout volume. Try 6 x 3min (60sec rest) and 3 x 6min (90sec rest) to start. That’ll give you 18min of quality in each session, which is still on the low end for the time volume you’re doing per week. You can add more in coming weeks to get up to 20%, then assess from there. It‘s not that shorter intervals can‘t have their place in a system like this, but maintaining a pace for longer periods requires training mechanical efficiency too, and with 60sec/30sec you’re changing gears an awful lot. That’s why most everyone here is doing 3-4min as their shortest interval.",

As for the short reps, it's part of the build-up, but I might adjust it. I've said previously that I want to mimic Jakob's sessions (25 x 400 off 30s, 10 x 1K off 1 min and 5 x 6 min/2 min) by making them time-based, so I imagined Jakob runs the 400s at around 60 and Ks around 3:00. I've started with very little(10 x 30s/30s) and slowly extending the number and/or the length of the reps to adjust both to the increasing threshold volume and to the mindset, as I've been previously trained with polarized training. The plan is to get to 5 x 3:00/1:00 and then go in 2 directions, 1/ towards 10 x 3:00/1:00 and 2/ towards 5 x 6:00/2:00. I will have to decide at some point if I want to keep the 60s intervals or go for longer, but for now I'm trying to shoot for 25 reps to have some decent volume before moving up. As for breaks, the HR raises during the interval and I'm starting the rest with the peak HR of the previous rep and jogging it doesn't lower HR too much. Maybe when the reps get longer I will have more stable HR during the reps and more chances to drop it during the breaks. During the last 5 x 2:00/0:45 session I had no cardiac drift from rep to rep, so I don't know if I have to dial back on effort, but will error on cautious side whenever I feel like it.",

What you are already proposing: Sub-T with intervals ranging from 3-10mins adding up to around 30 mins of work in total. 2. Marathon pace continuous runs of around 45mins, perhaps up to 1h (the pace would likely be below MP, more around high-end aerobic if you are closer to elite) 3. Shorter Sub-T intervals: Sub-T with intervals of 30 secs to 90 seconds depending on level of runner, but roughly 200m and 400m intervals ranging from mile pace up to 8k pace. Also, possible to include 800m interval at 15k pace. This is what many call the easy interval method developed by Verheul and adapted by Klaas Lok. Think of it this way on a spectrum of sub-T stimulus: continuous 3hr pace run to long intervals (sirpoc method) to short intervals (verheul method) all performed at a pace that ideally stays just under LT2. I have tried all of them all and my preference over the years has shifted more from continuous MP runs (which I did almost daily that is difficult to believe now, but I had no life stress at that point, so was able to absorb it) to short intervals. The way I think about long sub-T vs. short sub-T intervals is there are trade offs: Long sub-T intervals (say 6x1k, 3x2k, 2x3k for a slower runner) has the advantage of accumulating a lot of running right below threshold, but it does not involve faster paces, so doesn't engage full range of muscle fiber activation, neuro-muscular adaptation, etc. (for example HM-30k pace all involve high activation of slow twitch, but little fast twitch, etc.) Short sub-T intervals (20x200m, 15x400m) has the advantage of practicing faster paces with fast twitch activation, running economy, etc. as above, but it does not accumulate as much running right below threshold due to HR rising and declining during shorter intervals. This results in a lower average HR than long sub-T intervals. Think of it this way if LT2 occurs at HR 170, a 2k run will have the majority of it in 165-170, whereas a 400m interval will have less than half of it in that HR range. Even if the total distance covered is the same shorter intervals result in lower total load than longer intervals. So I think those are the main tradeoffs between the two. Long sub-T intervals are basically a happy medium between continuous and longer MP runs and shorter sub-T intervals. Just my 2 cents.",

After running, I tear open the alcohol wipe, rub over two fingers (usually middle and ring of left hand) and also over index and thumb of my right hand to avoid contamination. Then I tear open the pad and dry the alcohol. Prick with the lancet on one of the two wiped fingers, press out a drop, wipe off with the pad, press out a drop again. You want the drop to be large, because you want to dip the top of the lactate pro strip into the top of the drop pressing down into your finger.

Forget doubling, you are aiming for the higher end of sub threshold. Whatever that number is in terms of lactate, means absolutely nothing unless you have done testing yourself. But, it's been clearly stated it's pushing towards the boundary of LT2. It's more aggressive than doubles. I wouldn't worry too much about what KI has done lately, he has lost his way a bit. He's lactate testing a bit blind in my opinion and has lost any real purpose. Experimenting perhaps, pushing too hard in patches, just basically not getting any consistency whatsoever, which is what this plan is all about. Whereas I think this thread if you follow the training load quantification aspect, you will probably understand where you want to get to, rather than just testing lactate - especially for the athlete who is old and also has limited time on their hands. Whether the trolls like it or not, sirpoc himself is the absolute standard bearer of this method. I would urge anyone to look at what he's doing. It's remarkable how he continues to work out how to progress. Key note here is the lactate testing is pretty much only a tiny part of the plan, which makes it a ton more practical and why so many people have had success copying him.",

My point is that whether you run 85 or 95% of LT doesn't have a big difference on your cardiovascular system. Mechanical, yes, but, your gains will most likely be the same whether you run and measure 2.5 or 3.0 during for example 5x6 minutes. My whole point with this was that if you have not taken the LT test yet, and want a simple way to start asap, you can run at the lower point of the range. This is also what Bakken has said.

As much as I enjoy the chat in this thread and the science, I can't help but think we are trying to over complicate things. For a hobby guy in either sport, sirpoc has got to the top fraction of a %. Probably even more so actually in running, if you consider he's 41 and probably going to run sub 15 soon. I guess maybe a dozen guys in the whole of the UK might do that this year in that age group? I would probably bet, he trains the least amount of hours to get there. Maybe I'm wrong, but I can't imagine it's much more than that number of runners. The main takeaway though is how disciplined this mo for is and consistent. Being able to do the same thing, week in, week out stick to the basics and fundamentals of what you are doing and look at the results? Of course if you wanted to dial in performance more he could add some specificity. But does it matter? I'd rather be an all round distance hobby jogger hero rather than dialing in just to get another 5 seconds in a 5k.

Other training approaches consider a few aspects: cardiovascular, physiological, psychological, and even gastrointestinal. My take on the sir_poc approach/NSA is that it clearly tries to optimise cardiovascular fitness given available time around 7 hours, but I'm interested in whether by ignoring the other facets it is suggesting they matter far less than thought, or are just not mentioned so far. Being clearer for each: Physiogical: I've not seen any mention of drills to include strides, skips, plyos or anything else which stands to improve running economy or strengthen and prepare joints and tendons for increased load (possibly including general strength too). Do we consider them irrelevant in this approach, or are we still recommending them in parallel? Psychological: many runners refer to the psychological benefits from knowing how a certain pace feels or being more confident they can hold it or something around it for a portion of what they would in a race. Do we accept that trusting the approach *is* the psychological advantage here? Gastrointestinal: perhaps more relevant for the marathon, how do you train your gut for intense work whilst absorbing carbs and liquids without doing long runs to simulate?",

Physiological: Generally no harm in doing a few strides after easy runs a 1-2x a week. Same with strength if you have some underlying weaknesses worth addressing. If you feel you benefit from it then by all means do some, I guess what this approach shows is that doing loads of it is probably not required. Psychological: probably not necessary strictly speaking, but there are plenty of examples of people doing 1-2 indicator/specific workouts (even Almgren pre-Valencia did a session which seemed to be a bit more of a tester/confidence booster). Overall I think trusting the process is a pretty good approach to building enough confidence, but we’re all different. Again, wouldn’t overdo it on this stuff though. Gastrointestinal: it’s clear that for the Marathon something in this approach needs to change, if at the very least scaling the Long Run quite significantly to 2hr+ and perhaps including some chunks at pace for a couple of them in the final 5-6 weeks pre-race.

Spoc is coming from years of performing at a high level in cycling time trials so I'm sure he was used to the suffering already, but if you've never run some of these distances before, the mental reset after each rep is so nice in training but could backfire on race day.

    "msg": "Thanks for bringing this back up! Good reminder of old wisdom – sirpoc is a fantastic bloke and exemplar of this training's success, but would be the first to say this this is not shiny or new. One thing that I often think about (and have found good success with) over the years is something that sirpoc continues to emphasize in his posts: he would likely train differently if he was much LESS or much MORE time constrained. I've seen huge improvements with this adapted sub-T in singles approach (7-8 hours per week running) and follow it more closely than, for example, Tinman's CV-focused approach, but there is value to adapting my training depending on my weekly time constraints which do vary quite a bit when I travel for work. However, when I get down to weeks of <3 hours running per week (during work travel), 20-25% weekly volume in sub-T is simply not that much and my fitness declines sort of quickly after two weeks reduced volume. But, when I introduce slightly more intensity at these lower volumes (without resorting to VO2 reps), such as 8x3 min at CV pace or the 25x1 min sub-T workout, I seem to bounce back to full volume and intensity more quickly after a couple weeks of reduced volume. This is just anecdotal though and works for me as a mid-twitch (neither fast-twitch, nor slow-twitch) guy.",
