For repeated sub-threshold training, it all comes down to which factors influence recovery the most. The heat stress is showing up in elevated heart rate, but since lactate is not rising, work at the higher heart rate is still sub-threshold. The concern would be whether doing all that work in the heat causes a greater load that is not captured by lactate measurements and you're just going to cook yourself despite hitting lactate targets -- but broadly speaking, the reason lactate measurements are popular is because they're a better proxy for work than HR, and your recovery depends way more on that than your core temperature, hydration status, elevation, etc. If you feel the same as always during a sub-threshold workout in the heat, then look down and see your HR is 5 bpm higher, you probably should not be concerned.",

And you suggesting using Mod Dmax instead of Dmax doesn’t change my lactate curve, so choosing that point is as arbitrary a basis as Dmax or LT2. I genuinely don’t understand how this is such an issue for you. I’ve always been a low producer of lactate, that just appears to be my physiology. An example of a more prominent athlete, is Reed Fischer. He recorded a video of his LT and VO2max test. His lab tested LT2 was 1.3 mmol/l. Alberto Salazar is another example, per Jack Daniels own data. Also, take a look at some of the curves Andy Jones published based on his testing of all the athletes involved in the Breaking 2 project. There’s a lot of variation there. Also, Jones uses LT and LTP to describe LT1 and LT2, so please make sure to email him and tell him he is doing it wrong. Yes, there’s always the possibility of hydration, glycogen levels, and time of day playing a role. I did my best to control for this by eating and hydrating well (pretty standard for me anyway) and starting at the same time each morning. The whole point of this was to present some ”real-world” data in a hot and humid environment as opposed to on a treadmill, in a lab. For most of us, training doesn’t take place there.",

So, trying to keep the whole session below LTHR would result in running a pace much slower than I could actually run and still stay at a lactate below 2.0. Does that make sense?

As for whether strides are useful: my theory which has absolutely no hard evidence is that while many can get away with skipping strides or other short reps, some people (like me) find that they're absolutely critical to running well. Sirpoc can lock in to sub 3:10 pace over a 5k even though the fastest (that I could see) he's gone in training is somewhere in the mid 3:10s. Even at my fittest aerobically, I feel like I'm sprinting at my 5k pace if I've been skipping strides. I used to think that the solution to this would be hard Vo2 reps on the track, or 1km reps at goal 5k pace to 'get used to' running faster over an extended period. I'm now trying the system described in this thread so I'm not ever going quicker than 10k pace during a session but I'm doing a set of strides at the end of each warmup so my body doesn't 'forget' how to move at 1500m-3k pace.

Haven't run another time trial but based on the comments here I decided to stick with the plan until the fall to see the experiment through. Haven't changed anything except. Just tried to pay more attention and make sure the easy days are as easy as they can be in the heat. Honestly, it was pretty much just more of the same slog. This week we finally got a cool front. For context, the last three months running conditions most mornings have been around 75-85F and dewpoints 65-75F. This week a cold front came through (isn't sticking around unfortunately) and I've been running around 65-70F with dewpoints in the 55-60F. The week after the 5k TT I was disappointed in (same ~20:55 result as one I ran in February) I ran my normal Thursday 7x1k w/ 1 minute rest: Last rep 5 seconds slow than first, generally disappointing, and felt pretty consistent compared to recent efforts. Same workout today: I finished this morning's session out like a hummingbird. Felt like I could've run another 4 or 5 reps at the pace I finished interval 7 at (6:24/mile) or quicker. Breaths were easy and long, legs were light and quick, effort felt very moderate. Last rep 20 seconds faster than first and wasn't trying to press it at all, each one just kind ended up feeling looser than the last. My 3x2k on Tuesday was similarly strong. It felt/feels like I'm inhabiting a completely different body. I've looked at a few workouts from before I started on subT workout but it's hard to compare since I didn't really run anything at this effort, either above or below. At any rate, I don't think there's anyway I could've hacked todays paces on 1 minute rest at all, and certainly wouldn't have finished my cool down feeling like I could do it all over again. Thanks to everyone who responded that my TT actually indicated improvement compared to when I started this all several month ago. I was quite concerned about the only goal I had set for the year (which was to improve at least somewhat on my 10k from last fall where I ran a 7:10/mile pace when I run it again in a couple month). After this week I'm not super worried anymore even with more heat coming back into the forecast for a bit.

What got me here? -Masters athlete -Stagnating last years -Reflections on my training from last years My are PBs all from 2019/20/21 with one expection. Last year when I accepted for myself the PBs might be over for this life I ran a half marathon PB in October. Sadly I got injured right after that and took my 6 months with running very little till was able again to run 4-5 times a week. I did cross train though a lot during fall and winter. And I spent quite some time looking for reasons how I got this unexpected PB on the half. The explanation and think to have found in my training logs. I always was on very good shape when training specifically for a half. After that often I also did run good 10km and 5km. But the more I then focussed on shorten distances (also tried two track season) did help me lowering my times significantly. Als I recognized that continuous tempo/threshold runs were often the hardest for me. In training plans often I need manage to achieve as they were intended whereas I had no issues for the shorter intervals up to 1000m. So last year I decided that I would try work on this weakness and incorporated one longer threshold (half marathon pace) run per week. That was probably one important element for the HM other than that I did not trained even too hard last summer. During current season I decided to look out more specificly for ideas around threshold based training or training which would help me work on my \"tempo endurance\" deficit. I am closed to 50 and definetely on the slower side in this thread. Ran a 20:59 on 5000 track and my best parkrun this year only 21:45 or so on a very good course. Stumbling on this thread 2-3 months ago and worked completely through it I started transitioning on the Sub-T concept mit July. In average I have done 2 Sub-T sessions a week. Had two races which has cost me 2 of those sessions each with taper and recovery after. Will report on my progess here and on Strava. Next two weeks will be hard to follow exact structure as I have some races and will just easy runs in-between (or use races to go on Sub-T pace). So more datapoints on my current fitness to come. and from 2nd September week will to very consitent Sub-T block of 6-8 weeks and see how I respond to this.",

I probably won't have another chance to race until spring at least, but I'm hoping to do 5K-HM next summer on similar or the same courses as recent races, which should give me a good sense of what this training can do. A few more notes: - I'm using a SubT-Easy-SubT-Easy-SubT-Long-Off schedule. - Hitting 3 workouts a week seems like a key ingredient. Even at just 3-4 miles of volume at pace, the frequent stimulus hits different. - I notice some cumulative fatigue with each workout, which may not be the goal. Or maybe stressing recoverability is the point? I'm still adjusting workouts and paces. - Getting up to 4 miles of workout volume is useful, as it opens up the longer intervals (2K/3K). 3 x 2K has actually been one of the more difficult workouts, while 2 x 2mi has been fine. Go figure. - At 12 miles of workout volume per week, I'm putting in more work at pace than in any of my previous race buildups and doing a higher percentage of up-tempo running. - I wonder how much of the improvement is mechanical. According to Garmin, my weekly average steps per minute and stride length are noticeably higher. That's got to have some kind of effect. - Without any races, I might try a steady-10K alternation workout once a month or so as a loose fitness check. - I'm currently experimenting with 6 miles of total workout volume just to see what it's like. 3 x 2mi wasn't too bad.

I switched over to 2 Sub T/2 easy/2 gym, eventually added in a 3rd easy and with pretty good adherence to the method over the previous 3 months, got my 5km down to 18:22 in June/2024. This was on 50km/week with 16km at SubT. Following the advice of the group, in July 22nd this year I moved up to 3 SubT/3 easy/2 gym for a total of 60km/week with 20km at SubT. I rotated the standard sets of 0.4km, 1km, 1.6km and 2km reps with slightly smaller sessions. I did this for only 2 weeks and then smashed my HM PB by 3 min + for a 1:24:13 with no long run. I then ran a 5km a week later and ran a 17:46.” I should update by saying I’ve now seen some workouts dip below 4 - most notably a 4 x 2km @ 3:58 av pace in carbon plates. I was hoping I was getting fitter, but in saying that, 2 days ago I did a 6 x 1km @ 3:58s, struggled through it, RPE was probs 8 and felt I overran, so go figure.",

The workouts themselves (4 x 1.5 miles, 6 x 1 mile, 12 x 800) went fine, but it took longer to recover from the second session and I needed a second easy day before the third workout. The problem wasn't fatigue, but persistent soreness in my hamstrings/glutes and I didn't want to push too close to the edge. So I think I can build up to it, but I'm not there yet. \"High volume, not high mileage\" is an accurate description. It's really nice to be able to fit a workout into little more than an hour. It's a lot easier on family life than telling my wife that I'm heading out for a 20 miler that will take 3 hours or so. And I actually feel pretty good physically the rest of the day, instead of feeling wiped out afterwards. One thing that will be an issue is trying to keep the sub-threshold volume to 25% of weekly volume. On six days, I was somewhere over 33% last week (18 miles sub-T and just over 50 total). So I also need to build up overall mileage, which honestly seems slightly more challenging than hitting the three sub-T workouts. Since the challenge for me is recovering, I've had to cut back on lifting a lot. I'll try adding it back in once I reach a stable plateau in workout volume and weekly mileage.",

He did mile reps last week with a few under 5:10. That’s right around 10k pace and incredibly close to 5k pace. He’s either due for some massive PBs or is just so strong from all the threshold work that his paces are really close together. Even his easy runs are sub-7 minute mile pace now.
