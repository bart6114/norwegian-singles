What's important is that you don't understand that your understanding of the \"Norwegian approach\" is flawed. A hobby runner who has little time and wants to avoid injuries would start with a training program and see, for example, whether four or five days are better for him at the beginning instead of six or whether he is too fast in training. If you fail here, you will naturally stagnate. I get the impression that you are doggedly sticking to one idea. A real runner wants and needs to be fast. That has proven its worth. But go ahead.",

Of course, specific mileage and pacing is largely dependent on where the specific athlete is in their fitness, cycle, etc.. Does anyone take this approach when structuring their sessions?

    "msg": "Hey Curious1. I recently spoke with sirpoc84 about the TSS score range and his thoughts. He and I have both been seeing a range of about 75-85 TSS, but my workouts included 3.25 miles of easy running (1.75 warmup and 1.5 cool-down), so too much of the load was coming from easy running. I'm going to be doing 1.25 miles for warmup and 1 mile for cool-down moving forward, and adjust interval time/distance in order to find the combo that puts me in that 75-85 TSS per workout range. I just ran a 5k trial yesterday and PR'd, so I'll be working with updated and faster paces, which is why I want to start with 30 minutes of intervals each workout and hopefully move toward 36 minutes per workout. I figure if my fitness improves as I use my new paces, I'll naturally need to add reps, time, or distance in order to achieve a similar TSS score for the same pace. I'd started to run faster paces this past week due to not hitting the right % of threshold HR, which prompted me to do a 5k trial. But I will never again increase the pace without getting a new 5k trial PR, and will instead add time, distance, or reps. I'm gonna start sticking to paces based on threshold pace from a VDOT or other Daniels-style calculator instead of max HR during an interval rep. So, I'll be using the 75-85 TSS score to assess whether I'm going too easy or too hard. My HR just seems to go all over the place to trust it as the primary metric, but I'll certainly be checking it at the end of reps just to be sure I'm not going over the HR threshold. But I really am starting to believe that using a recent time trial to calculate threshold pace, using updated paces based on that time trial, monitoring TSS, and possibly grabbing a lactate meter will be the best way forward. In lieu of a lactate meter, I'll rely more on recent trial or race PR, updated paces, and 75-85 TSS as my guiding light. I'm also hoping that if I hit 85 TSS one day, that I stay below that on the other two days to get a 3-workout average closer to 75-80 TSS. I know, I went way off topic, but I hope some of what I've said here helps.",

On the other hand, I've seen it mentioned that focusing on your weakness might be the key, so that I would flip the previous scenario and focus more on the longer intervals to build aerobic fitness a bit more. Because I'm unsure which approach is wiser, I've opted to just cycle between 3-min, 6-min, and 10-min reps, and have enjoyed them all. Definitely keeps things from being to mundane. Due to my lack of 5k speed, I don't hit 1k/2k/3k for these reps, and thus time is my focus. I don't enjoy the treadmill at all, but maybe it'll be okay for workouts since I find the faster speeds more enjoyable. Easy runs on the treadmill are the worst, and I always feel like I'm moving faster for a given pace than I am outdoors.

You can go and hypothetically kill yourself in all your workouts, but what are you actually training? Doing crazy fast repeats will only give you marginal vo2 max benefits and form benefits. To actually get fast you need to be training the sub LT2 zone whilst keeping the easy runs aerobic enough to recover and benefit from the training. This zone is trainable. Personally I'm quite a bit faster than 1:15 so always try to be careful about talking about how easy it is to run certain times as a lot of people get caught up on the 'talent' aspect and how they will never be able to do something. But I think if you train your whole life to break 1:15 and can't do it then you are just not training properly.

Firstly, I find it hilarious people think I might be secretly doing some \"special\" work, as if I would come on a niche internet forum to lie about it ha ha. No, just 4x easy (including easy \"long\") and 3x sub threshold, with the odd parkrun thrown in to keep me honest, see how/if I've improved and just to stop myself getting bored. It's very boring, I've seen that mentioned. But I enjoy getting better, this is the best way , I believe, for most people to get better. I was cycling roughly like this 10 years ago. So after a bit of disappointment messing around with Daniels style, this is where I am at. Someone also mentioned consistency. Absolutely spot on. I've said before, if I wanted to get fit in maybe 8 weeks, this is probably the worse way to train. But if you don't have a specific distance in mind from 5k (maybe less, I haven't tried) through HM, it's a really good generalised plan, with little risk. But you really do have to think long term. Miracles aren't going to happen overnight. As I said, if you maybe only have 6-8 weeks, roll the dice and do a more aggressive plan and see what happens. But if you are thinking 6+ months, then this in my opinion, is the best go to. On the subject of talent, I don't think I'm especially talented. I have no evidence of that particularly. But I do know I have zero natural speed. It was the same on the bike. I could train myself to go from untrained on the bike to 320w FTP at a pretty light weight, but my max 5 seconds power was like 750w pretty much no matter what I did (trained or untrained). It's the same with running, I can pretty much fill the distances in between 5k -hm on predicted pace, but I doubt I could run 600-800m at what now my 1500m pace comes out at. In fact, I know I can't. But , the good news as someone mentioned , threshold is easily trainable, it seems. On top of that, managing training loads etc happens to work really well (if done correctly) around these paces. So if you stick to it, I would say more people than not, will make the big gains long term. Final thing, FWIW, I think the best gauge of talent was when you were a kid. Here in the UK we run cross country as almost a punishment in PE at school. I wasn't over weight as a kid, played football, but wasn't great in these races. Worth remembering I think those \"races\" are a good talent spotter, as nobody ran or trained (like nobody at that age here) and I used to finish just under halfway in the field, maybe 70 out of 120 would be a normal result for me. Anecdotal, but indicates I was never even remotely spotted or picked up like the faster kids were to maybe taken their running further and actually train. I wasn't fat or anything really when I started running 2.5 years ago and suddenly was a sub 20 runner on little training. It took a while to get there and even for a lot of months I was slow, doing 5k time trials in maybe 24 ish. It took me a while to get sub 20 and then just as long again to grind myself down further.

Along with very easy easy runs, and shorter/slower long runs than a slow twitch athlete would do. Which sounds suspiciously a lot like this approach - which is sub threshold in terms of net stimulus, not threshod, even if the interval pace is at or above threshold pace. The interval aspect probably makes it even easier for a FT person to do than marathon effort tempos etc as well. Probably not by accident either, if it was mostly developed for 1500-5k runners. Which maybe you wouldn't consider pure fast twitch, but they definitely have some wheels, unlike sirpoc who does seem to be more classic ST and aerobically talented given his success in cycling. It probably matters what the target event is too. No matter how good of a sprinter you are, if your goal is to run a fast marathon you better get some practice running moderately fast for a long time, cause that's exactly what the race will be.",

They look at better 100-400 times than 5k and go they are speed based. That just reflects that you hit more of your speed max with zero training.

David Roche, of Some Work All Play, mentions on his podcast often that he is fast twitch. He used to be a football player. He runs ultras now. His training isn’t really different than what most ultra runners do. He talks about how he has gradually shifted his physiology over time.

Similarly, someone can be extremely ST, but because of poor biomechanics, can be beaten in a long distance race by someone more FT.

My understanding is that these differences can’t be trained away.

The revelation of SDHJ’s lactate test and thoughtfully shared point regarding personalization, made me think of the Hadd thread and how his core principles parallel this thread. Particularly, how one’s general aerobic conditioning is often the biggest limiter. For those interested, I’ll link a summary document that was put together years ago by a follower of that thread. Hadd’s 5*2400m HR Test protocol is the main aspect which I thought may be helpful to those without a lactate meter and/or those who feel they may be “underdeveloped” aerobically. Without going into all the detail (it’s included in the document), the general test protocol is the following: 2400m at 70% HRMax with 90 seconds recovery 2400m at 75% HRMax with 90 seconds recovery 2400m at 80% HRMax with 90 seconds recovery 2400m at 85% HRMax with 90 seconds recovery 2400m at 90% HRMax with 90 seconds recovery You could use the first 800m to lock into the effort/pace then take the time and average HR value for each 1600m as the representative value for that repeat. The objective being that you want to see a “tight” relationship across the entire spectrum of paces, thus indicating you have a strong aerobic engine. A good relationship would be approximately 4-5 seconds per 400m difference as you move through those HR percentages. So, for example: 1:46 per 400m @ 70% HRMax 1:42 per 400m @ 75% HRMax 1:38 per 400m @ 80% HRMax 1:34 per 400m @ 85% HRMax 1:30 per 400m @ 90% HRMax There are obviously many test protocols one could create, as have been shared already on the thread. The main motivation for sharing this one though is the feedback it provides across a spectrum of paces, as opposed to one specific pace.

That would be the signal that you’ve reached your target from the perspective of fully establishing an aerobic base. Also, to clarify, I don’t think you have to follow Hadd’s approach regarding workouts (he primarily utilized straight tempos, as opposed to intervals ) but the general principle of “pushing” the threshold down as opposed to “pulling” it down, paired with the emphasis on being patient and consistent and not forcing the training, I think, is the emphasis of a threshold based training system. Using his test protocol is primarily a way to get a concrete estimate of the pace and HR (if using that) to stay between. Meaning, where your fitness is actually at as opposed to where it should theoretically be, as was the case with SDHJ’s recent experience. P.S. If you do read the document, it talks in detail about all of this.
