I started again as laid out, after another 3 months really started to get the benefit. If you look at sirpoc, he has basically changed nothing in terms of weekly make up, only some increased time. That tells you all you need to know and has stuck to the 7 day schedule and he's STILL improving. I'm in the Strava group myself, it's actually great, fantastic adult discussions like the old days of LR. One thing I notice, the people who have not had success of which there are some , or the few people who have dug themselves into big holes, are the ones who have changed a lot, to the point you couldn't even say it resembles this method. I won't pick on anyone, but there was even a guy with a lactate meter who managed to dig themselves a big hole. The only thing anyone might need to change, is the paces sirpoc put up. Especially if you are starting out and it feels too hard, it probably is. Even if you are within the guide. I've seen sirpoc post, the guide and paces applied to him and we're only a rough area. Although they seem to fit decent for most people, if you are really in aerobically developed, start off slower. I did this, within a month or so I almost now sit absolutely smack bang in the middle of the guide paced. Even then, this post I am replying to hits the nail on the head. Stick to the 7 day schedule unless you absolutely can't, for some reason. I always thought I couldn't run 7 days, now after 3 months of this I can't imagine not running all 7 days.",

A long run increases the day's load by ~20+ points of TSS over a regular E run, and that's following a peak-stress Q day, and will be followed by another peak-stress Q day, so I think if load management/resting is truly a requirement, I'd probably err on the side of keeping it E and trying to distribute that load over 3 days, over time, to more safely build the load into the week, and make sure the runner continues to feel like they can handle it. And then I think, over time, they'll probably find themselves feeling strong enough to train on that 7th day anyway, which would be the optimal outcome because it represents a more significant increase in weekly TSS. If cutting the day is just for time or convenience and the athlete is reasonably trained then yeah, I think that's a scenario where I'd default to keeping the LR in there and cutting the E. Maybe this is an overcautious approach, but to me the devilish thing about this system is that it's extremely simple as long as you follow the rules , but that means understanding exactly how the rules apply to body, and it also means that you're flirting with the edge pretty much the whole time by design.",

Not sure how necessary long warmups and cool downs really are with respect to adding weekly TSS (the cooldown in particular is going to be pretty inefficient.) If I recall correctly Sirpoc's stated theoretical preference for building volume in the form of doubles would be to add mileage to easy days to.

Turns out for me, even after running this program for 6 months, sirpoc's paces are WAY too fast for me. I ended up doing a step test, and found my LT2 is closer to 2.8-3.0mmol. I've been trying to run under that for the last month and once again feel amazing and very fast.

Hopefully you are in the Strava group, there's often some pretty good chat there. Personally I would only be adding stuff on to the easy days once you get up to 30-35 mins work in the sub threshold sessions. Since I reached that, I've g one from 40 mins to 1 hour easy run and have done the same from 75 up to 90 mins long run. It doesn't seem like a lot, but over time keeps the grind in an upward curve. I will say right now, I'm a bit stuck as to where to add stuff on. But, the absolute last resort would be to do anything to the Q days. As you have said, the whole thing is pretty much a tightrope as it is. That's probably where the most can go wrong, IMO. If I was going to double, I would start with maybe on a Monday , Wednesday or Friday doing two 35-40 min runs on one of those days, once a week. I've probably gotten to a level beyond what I expected and have become half decent it appears at masters level, so maybe I'll make that commitment when I final reach the limit I can grow my training (which is close). But I don't know, running is just a hobby to me and something to do and keep fit to replace cycling. I sort of agreed with myself I would commit an hour a day and 90 mins on a Sunday maximum. But we will see...... I'm also glad, although I think I've said it before, that you point out this isn't like a magic system. It's still very hard to do. Mentally and sometimes physically just to be bothered to do the same thing over and over again. I'll sound like a broken record, but if I had 3-4 hours a week, I wouldn't train like this. If I had 12 hours a week, I also wouldn't train like this. I still think this is pretty specific to around the 4.5-8 hour range to give it it's full of broadest scope. That just happens to be the majority of people 35+ with busy working lives. I'm glad people are having success, it's a it embarrassing sometimes that people have made me as some sort of guardian for this training, but if it's helped people I'm glad.

There was an interesting reply to his video in the comments:- \"@stephenscullion262 I disagree with you that the saturday workout is the key session in the week for the double threshhold high mileage model. I am a norwegian distance runner and 'our' model is specifically tailored for 1500m to 10km. The double threshhold tuesday and thursday + 2x10x200m hillsprints on saturday is only what you do from october to may, then you lower your mileage slightly and start to train harder closer to the racedays in the spring and summer (around 7-8 mmol for example in may). VO2max is great for running fast, but it is NOT the single most important thing. We have plenty of sub 29 min 10km runners with VO2 max well below 70. Having a control over your lactate and speed in training is the key to consistency (besides eating enough food and sleeping of course). THIS IS NOT A MARATHON MODEL. You can always find a good reason for running faster than threshold, but the reason you find will never be more important than your total volume of threshold training (for 1500m -> 10km/half marathon). It is all about assigning a weight to the good arguments when you have multiple good arguments. Of course you need 'harder' training but, the harder stuff should NEVER be prioritized over mileage when you are not racing during the winter. Of course there is not a one solution that fits every runner, but this is our philosophy. Your ability to not accumulate lactate is MUCH MORE IMPORTANT than your ability to push hard while already having a high amount of lactate in your body, if you run 1500m or longer races. Threshold is a level of intensity, not one specific pace. So how do we solve the ''problem'' of not running fast enough? We use lactate as an INTENSITY LEVEL. Your threshold pace is something that is session-specific. You can obviously run faster at 2.5mmol lactate in a 400m x25 session than you can in a 2000m x6 session. The fastest runner in a distance race is USUALLY the man who has the least stiff legs before the last laps, not the guy who fights for his life while having already stiff legs. Feel free to ask any questions! We still try to find a good model for the marathon in Norway, but we haven't gotten close to anything as good as our 1500m->10000m/half marathon model yet. The norwegian model is also something that will not work for just a couple of months of training. It is a long term model that works best over a few years of measuring and comparing your lactate levels from previous years and increasing your volume every year.\"",

Between 2-3 hours a day every day for months at a very easy pace, to create the same load and same result he could in half the time with a mixture of sweetspot. You probably could achieve the same results with less intensity, but take longer doing it. But what on earth is the point?

For example if you ran at 99% of threshold, the 3.5 exponenet would adjust that percent to 96.5%. 101% would be adjusted to 103.5%. 90% would be adjusted to 69.2%.",

Once you know that, you can jump into a 3 ST session workload immediately, no real need to build up to it like you would a real workout. The disadvantage to using pace based off a race result is that bodies are different and there’s a chance you may hit LT2 before that pace (a number of people have reported that in the Strava group). To me, the worst case scenario would be spending weeks/months building up to repeats that are too fast to be sustainable but not realizing it because you don’t have a sense for the RPE and you think this is supposed to feel harder than it is, then eventually realizing things aren’t working and having to spend even more time resting and/or dialing it back. It can’t be stressed enough — overwork is easy to do if you don’t know what we’re doing, because we’re literally talking about a difference of seconds per KM per repeat, and it can really sneak up on you, even intra-workout. If you must freestyle, then I would take some time to read the descriptions of RPE shared by people who have been doing this a while and confirmed their impressions with measurements.

It may be wise to start at 20% and see how you respond. If you're at 6hr weekly, 8x 3min will give you most of the stimulus needed (20%). It's the last 2 reps/ 6 min where you're most likely to tip over. In the big picture it's the 3rd quality workout with a 'long run' that creates the load over time and 20% will get you there with less risk. I'm starting at 20% of time because I'm coming back from injury and faster running is more likely to irritate my hip.

If the duration is the same but the percent of threshold is different, then the workout with the higher percent of threshold will yield a higher score. Any time not running is not counted.
