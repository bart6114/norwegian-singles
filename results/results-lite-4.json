The solution to this problem is that you can use your HR avg of the last min of your last rep. If the avg HR of the last min of the last rep is below around 92%HRmax you are in good shape.

    "msg": "I'd recommend the Polar OH1 or whatever the new one is called - you can put it on the arm/forearm. I have used it with very good success. Much better than the wrist one on my Garmin 235. For those wanting to do this without lactate, I think it is doable using pace and HR. I did it for a few months last winter. I actually did all workouts on the treadmill so I could calibrate pace. Basically you start with a pace that is definitely doable and gradually progress the pace and the volume. I had a rough sense of my max HR, and wanted an absolute max of 90% of that. I found that workouts were manageable to recover from and stay consistent if I only approached that on the last rep or 2. And roughly, to the naked eye, mostly stable with only a few beats of HR drift in the last half of the workout. If drifting too much or getting up to 90% too early, I was going too hard. I lived in a very hilly area at that time, so I found the treadmill to be the best option to do this. Fun fact, Kristoffer Ingebrigtsen uses a wave light at the track to make sure his pace is accurate (if I'm understanding his posts correctly). So it seems the way they do it is target a pace, and monitor HR and lactate over time to ensure that it is the correct effort. No single workout is the end all or be all, so you can sort of track the values over time and adjust for the next workout. Interestingly, I have mostly had success in the winter. I have found in hot weather I end up trying to run outside and 1) workouts end up harder than intended (if I ever checked lactate I'm sure it would show this) and 2) easy runs end up with HR drift no matter what the pace is, so definitely above that 70%, and likely 75%+. I have no issues running < 70% HR in the winter. In the summer, I have not been able to run more than 2x threshold workouts per week consistently, but have compensated with a progression in the Long Run (though probably over do this). Because this is a \"long term vision\" system, I think a gradual increase is important, so it won't set you back much to start a bit below what you think you can do in terms of volume and pace on the intervals. If you can have a consistent stable HR and feel ok, you can gradually work up to where you want to be. But probably more gradually than you think.",

    "msg": "Wow! This thread has really taken off again in the last two days, awesome! There are some interesting details being shared and ideas floated! I don’t want to turn this into a training manifesto (LOL), but I have a concept to pose to the group. The idea of blood lactate readings vs intensity and duration. If LT1 and LT2 are defined as a pace for a specified duration, those durations can be fairly accurately estimated using a race result. I’d even propose using a time trial as that will probably not result in as fast a time as a race but could actually prove more useful for training. Sirpoc has said, and I agree, the fatigue you carry during training usually results in a small percent reduction in training paces when compared to what you actually race at, assuming you are running consistently. It’s not that hard to find a consistent route or hit the track and do a 3K-10K time trial. Nut up folks! LOL I brought up Daniels and mentioned how I found his T pace sightly too intense when doing regular tempo interval sessions, so I ran at or slightly slower than half marathon pace instead. Well, for me, a few seconds slower per mile than my half marathon pace is a pace I could hold for 90 minutes. I mention this because the pace also correlates to about a 3.5 mmol blood lactate value for me. Which, when I was using a lactate meter, is where I settled into for my tempo interval sessions, 3.0-3.5 mmol. Tinman on a thread from YEARS ago (perhaps before I was born LOL), provided a conversion table for tempo training as follows: 4.0 mmol = 1.07*(5K_Race_Pace) 3.5 mmol = 1.10*(5K_Race_Pace) 2.5 mmol = 1.13*(5K_Race_Pace) Tinman knows there can be variations in those readings, but I believe he provided them as a general guide (this may have been before he created his calculator even). If memory serves me correct, he said the paces would approximately work out to LT, half marathon, and marathon, respectively. If you read Marius Bakken’s training page, not only does he detail his training and experience, he provides the general outline of the Ingebrigsten’s training and a link to an interview with Kristian Blummenfelt’s coach, Arild Tveiton. They all reference plenty of threshold work in the 2.5-3.5 mmol range. Brad Hudson in his book, Run Faster, references using 60, 90, and 150 minute race pace for threshold sessions. Guess what, if you do the math (and I did LOL), the multiples Tinman gives, the lactate values we see being cited by the Norwegians, the Zone 2 range commonly currently referenced… all of those work out to 60, 90, and 150 minute race pace. To associate those times with the current language, 60 minute race pace is LT1 and 150 minute race pace is LT2, with 90 minute race pace falling in between of course. Now, I tend to think most runners are not going to buy a lactate meter, lancets, and test strips. Whether it is the cost, practicality of use, or general lack of interest in being that technical. However, the associated paces are close enough. In fact, I’d call them speed barriers. Meaning, don’t see them as paces you have to hit, but paces to not exceed! Bringing this back to Jack. In 1979, Jack Daniels and Jimmy Gilbert published Oxygen Power. In it, he provides the regression equation he uses to derive his race prediction times. From that equation, you can calculate exactly your 60, 90 and 150 minute race pace if you know your vVO2Max. vVO2Max can be obtained by running a time trial (or race) that takes 8-10 minutes. It’s an estimate of course, but one that gives you a quantifiable starting point to gauge your sessions. Last point, and sorry for such a long post, even if YOUR lactate at those aforementioned race times varies from the standard BLa values, it is still a 60 minute, 90 minute, and 150 minute effort that is used to define the zones we see. Daniels amassed an incredible amount of research data. He states in his book while most runners will average a BLa of 4.0 mmol for their 60 minute pace, he’s measured runners with a range of, I believe, 2.8-7.2 mmol. I hope this reads as clear and robust as it plays in my head. Mainly, I hope it gives a different perspective and sparks further debate. P.S. Daniels derived a point system based on the intensity of your run and accumulated duration, so that you could standardize and track your training. That was published in his second edition in 2005.

    "msg": "Hi mate, FWIW the paces I posted back on the first page, I have no problem with using those as a calculation from a race, I do that all the time. It was to the people talking about LTHR race from an estimation. Not just the motivation from increased effort, it's the fact of nerves, all sorts that lead to an increased HR. As i said, there is zero chance my LTHR from the last 20 mins of my 10k race was correct. I was clearly way over LTHR. In fact, if you took my average for the entire race, it's clearly over LTHR. Until someone suggests something better, it's 20+ years old but Friel is the best solution for those wanting to do all of this with just a HRM. I don't generally hate the idea of these estimates of locked in % of paces etc, or Lexel converting them to a %of CV. The issue becomes when people run different numbers of reps, or run them different distances, different times. There is then endless variables. For instance, I can create the same level of lactate, for 25x400, through 10x1k up to 3x3k and even 4x10 mins, but the paces will be all varied. Yes you can index them to a pace, or a % of CV, but in my experience testing it doesn't create a nice linear graph, as in the easier slower reps generate less lactate and the harder/faster but shorter ones would create more. The one thing I can say for sure , is if I follow the pace guides I posted up (which are a guide , I hope people don't think they are the bible lol) that for me I will DEFINITELY be under 4mmol, I've tested this extensively. That's all I care about. I can without doubt handle that , 3 times a wee, no matter what. I also know that as I'm balls deep now for almost a year now.

I think you would burn through a lot of lactate pro strips trying to accurately derive the lactate curve yourself - I guess the lactate meter is best used for spot checking to keep your workouts at the correct pace (but the actual target is largely determined by the lab test). Perhaps an occasional LT lab test is worth it for a hobby jogger using this training system? Secondly, how do you know how far below LT is optimal to train at? Can one train at any pace between LT1 and LT2 and derive a training stimulus for 5k-marathon (adjusting volume accordingly)? For example, could you simply run intervals at marathon pace 5-6 days a week and never go above that pace outside races (seen some discussion on this already)?

Not 100% accurate, but good enough for any non-professional. i have seen others mentioned that idea too. There is still not even one intervention study which shows that training by lactate is better than training by HR. Since decades! Therefore counter arguments have their place and i have the feeling that any counter argument from others are now not welcome.

Bringing % of CV complicates it more I think for your average Joe than just saying run the 1ks at 15k pace or using the HRM solution offered. I stopped to Google and familiar myself with stuff like TSS, CTL and the PMC which didn't take long, then all that stuff made sense as well - I really learned something there and I am going to back catalogue my own data myself. I think what sets this thread apart is anyone can do it. We often have ex sub elites or current saying \"this is how you must train to run sub 15\" . But they are talented, have only trained one way (usually not like this) and we have NO IDEA what they could have run, had they trained like this, arguably more optimally. Here we have spoc84 in particular, as well as others - who have COMPARISONS to other ways they have trained. That is the key difference. We have something to base this off. As often we have natural runners who say \"this is how you must train\" when actually, often, even being sub 15, I think \"you could have done more\". Lets not forget, spoc isn't slow. He's just run 35.50 or something like that. That's not slow. That's way above average, even for letsrun. The key takeaway is that it's been compared, to another way to train - we don't often get that and solid rationale for why this way is better via the overall training load talk. I have no idea where he sits in terms of being fast, for cycling, but seems faster to me than his running? So that's two sports he's trained to make him way above average, relatively the same way. That makes me sit up and notice. Also I always enjoy shirtboys posts. Also very informative. Would love more little links like that , if possible. Hard2find, also really enjoyed your posts from the scientific point of view. What's great is you are all roughly on the same page - sharing ideas in real time and it makes a really awesome thread to read through. There's a book in it somewhere, for someone - or the main people involved in this thread. I've read much, much worse collaborations that have sold many copies by much less knowledgeable on the science or application of training. Anyway, my 2 cents and I hope there is more to come, but even if not, someone already said it I think but this will be included down the line in the \"must read\" and HOF LRC threads.",

For example, as a slow hobby jogger my LT pace is about 6:50 per mile and the corresponding power was 288 watts. I did a workout a few days ago and ran slightly faster than my usual LT pace and both my watches estimated threshold pace and my power increased accordingly. I also noticed that when it updated it was almost bang on my LTHR Hr of 164 when doing intervals. The critical power it estimates is essentially LT2.

I'm guessing it must use stuff like heart rate and estimation in its \"power\" calculation .There was a Cyclops power meter maybe 7-8 years ago, that was aimed for cycling - which was basically a soft strap heart rate band - that did something similar, guesstimated power based on an algorithm they claimed to have made from thousands of users data. This sounds similar I guess . Maybe I'll get one again, pop it on my shoe for a few months, forget about it and look it later.

Jack Daniels (jtupper) posts on it too. They were talking about this 19 years ago! Tinman references Jan Olbrecht on the thread. His book, The Science of Winning, is an excellent source for those interested in how bioenergetics and lactate interplay, as well as the athletes individual physiology. Btw, I believe he was the originator of the 30 min TT that cycling coaches later picked up and called Functional Threshold. He didn’t think it anymore useful than other tests though because it didn’t provide any insight into what the mechanism driving the results was. Sorry lexel LOL With that out of the way, I agree with the sentiment that we all agree on the generalities of this training approach. I don’t think there is one definitive way you have to train. To me, the superior way is the way that gets you fit and keeps you progressing and inspired! @Unbelief. There is such a range of terminology and quantification when it comes to LT1 and LT2 that I would never say, “It has to be this value.” I only gave the values to share what Tinman wrote (even though I did so incorrectly). I’m not that dogmatic nor insistent LOL. I’ve seen LT1 (the initial rise in lactate above baseline), given as 2.0-2.5 mmol in the research. I’ve even seen some refer to it as a 1.0 mmol rise above baseline. This is part of my point on why runners without a lactate meter (even those with one who are disinclined to order more strips) can use paces at different time durations and be confident they are in the correct range. Personally, as sirpoc has also shared, I go by effort. I know the feeling I want to have at different stages of the workout and try to tune in to that sensory data. I find it’s also helpful to have that ability to utilize in races to properly allocate your energy. There is however a positive linear relationship between oxygen up take and intensity. That relationship, averaged for all runners is what allows for the race and training pace formulas we see from Daniels and others like Tinman and Mcmillan. Those make use of the fact that the percentage of ones VO2 Max being used for any given duration is the same. If you set a distance, say 10K, and one runner covers it in 30 minutes and the other in 40 minutes, those runners will be at approximately 93% and 91% of their VO2Max, respectively. However, set time as the standard and both athletes will be working at the same relative effort in relation to their max but one will cover more distance in that time. All that bloviating to say, equating workouts and workload is likely more accurate and easily achieved by using pace in relation to max effort for a duration, not lactate. That’s largely why, forced to by no one but myself, I’d advocate 30 minute, 60 minute, 90 minute, and 150 minute race paces. One it allows for variety, which it’s said is the spice of life. Two, it spans the spectrum of intensities which show really good bang for your buck, while also fitting into the “Tempo Training” approach we are discussing. Plus, it’s sustainable over the long term. In the context of the three workouts per week and very much in line with what sirpoc is doing already would be the following 1. 90 sec repeats @ 30 min RP = 1.03*5K_Pace 2. 3 min repeats @ 60 min RP = 1.07*5K_Pace 3. 6 min repeats @ 90 min RP = 1.10*5K_Pace A fourth option for when the kids are at the grandparents and the wife is on a Real Housewives bender. 4. 12 min repeats @ 150 min RP = 1.13*5KPace You could use 1 min recoveries for all of those and just scale the volume to suit your fitness and savagery.",

I think. Which ultimately is what we are trying to do. This is even easier than me saying to my absolute beginner friend, who just wants to run, but start out doing some intervals , go run 5x1k at 15k Pace. FWIW , over time I would guess looking at those paces they are about what I would already target (not always hit, +-1%) and that over time, for me, would probably even out all the distances to roughly the same amount of lactate, comparing sessions. In fact, the most variable distance in terms of lactate for me, are the 5x2k sessions. That has had the widest range, when I have tested . Right down to 2.1 mmol once and absolutely up to the limit, another time. I've noticed this for KI as well on his longer repeats. I've also not noticed my pace being way too fast or his either.

Does this come to you as a big surprise I guess? Already back then they did \" double thresholds\". As some commentators in this thread already told this way of training threshold functions best with high mileage because the threshold pace is not individual optimal to trigger the lactate threshold development on low mileage. So, now to your questions. How would I coach SPOC 84, Kristoffer and the mighty Jakob Ingebrigtsen? Well, it doesn`t matter their different levels. What`s important to them all is this practical fundamental expression, \" Listen to your heart\". The individual heart is always telling you the shape of the day . Then you have to know at what effort you have to work to give the very best outcome of your workouts and easy runs. When going the low mileage way the lactate threshold training have to be most effective and more direct and close to \"maximum individual threshold pace\" in just one single session on a day compared to the \"double thresholds\" on lower concentration of lactate.

I genuinely go by effort and will look at paces and heart rate, and BLa readings (when I was testing) after the workout. I often experiment with different workout formats each year too. I got into doing workouts that always totaled 60 minutes several years ago. I simplified it down to three variation. A straight 60 minute tempo, tempo intervals with a 4:1 run to recovery ratio (so could be 12*4 min w/ 1 min up to 3*16 min w/ 4 min), and a fartlek with a 1:1 run to recovery ratio (typically 30*1min On/Off or 15*2min On/ Off). I observed that I would approximately average marathon pace on each of them, even though I was running different paces during the tempo, intervals, and fartlek. One could always scale that down (or up) and get essentially the same physiological benefit as the workouts I listed in the previous post. I really don’t think there is a magic set of workouts, more importantly a magic effort to tap into consistently over time to build fitness and enjoy the process! Anyway… LOL Regarding your variation in BLa on the 2K repeats, interesting! My initial reaction would be that the pace you are running for them is flirting with your LT2. If you look at plots of BLa as a function of a constant pace run over time, for the first 5 minutes or so, there is not always a significant rise in the reading when comparing a pace that steady states versus the next speed up that causes the lactate to rise precipitously. However, around 10 minutes, there will be a separation and then a further separation at each interval thereafter for however long the readings are taken. Btw, per your suggestion, I have really been looking into the TSS and CTL. I need some time to code everything up but along the lines of what you mentioned about trying to optimize your time training to get to the level you want is where I’m going with that.

    "msg": "I’ve wanted to reply to you and was hoping to spark a similar discussion as your second question posed with my 60, 90, 150 minute “thresholds” suggestion, which in no way are original. At this point in time as it relates to training, I think we are playing a game of refinement and not inventing. Plenty of coaches use these ranges, just in different forms of implementation. Some use straight tempos, some long intervals, some short intervals. Modifying the run to recovery ratio allows for a lot of possibilities. I think a lot depends too on the type of “system” you follow. For instance Jack Daniels is very, what I would call physiological parameter based. That is to say he looks at it as you want to improve your aerobic conditioning, lactate threshold, aerobic power, and running economy (he calls this speed too). To do that he thinks that running at the intensity to stress that physiological function is the best way to improve it. Hence, his Easy, Threshold, Interval, and Repetition paces. A lot of coaches have that same belief but will assign a range of paces to stress those functions. This is more the idea that, like muscle fibers, paces lie on a continuum and by manipulating the intensity, duration, and recovery, you can get the same stimulus as adhering strictly to one pace for each of the four physiological variables. Daniels himself has stated he believes marathon pace provides not physiological benefit that isn’t gained from running at the upper limit of his Easy pace, but he does make mention of doing continuous tempo runs longer than his standard 20 min at T pace. He even provides a chart in his second edition on how to adjust pace relative to duration. At 60 minutes, the pace (for most runners) converges to marathon pace. Jan Olbrecht, Renato Canova, Marius Bakken, and others, in slightly different ways, talk about how doing too much at or beyond LT will actually “pull the threshold down”. That is , you may be able to produce high levels of lactate as a result, but you will actually lower the speed at which your threshold occurs. You can think of this as your lactate curve shifting left or up and out to the left. Hence why they and many others like to use paces slower than what Daniels defines as T pace. However, depending on your event of focus, that may be a desirable trade off. Regarding lab testing, I’m near a large research university and they have a physiology department where you can go for VO2Max testing and/or lactate threshold testing. They even offer a discount for repeat visits. If you are just interested in your lactate curve though, I think you can achieve that on your own. Using a track (try as best you can to keep the pain even) or treadmill. The standard I see is to run 5 3 minute segments at an increasing intensity. I personally don’t think that’s enough of a step count to get a really well defined curve (assuming such a thing exists LOL). I generally go for 10 5 minute steps. It helps to have a good idea of where your threshold may be and aim for a 4-5% increase in pace. Also I try and get 2 readings that are definitively beyond the LT2. Hope that is helpful.",

So I write this with the utmost respect, to all but JS, and forgive me if I am repeating what everyone already knows. My collected thoughts are thus: To bring it back to the 'Norwegian system', which for argument's sake let's say is that outlined by Bakken on his website. Bakken argues: So, the Bakken system involves two key characteristics: lots of LT training and lots of volume. The common refrain on this forum has been that the former goes hand-in-hand with the latter - hobby joggers, don't even bother. What makes this thread so interesting is that, as pointed out by spoc initially, we observe significant progress from K Ingebrigtsen running pure sub-threshold with a modest amount of volume. Spoc and others have also observed this in themselves, with further (very interesting) corroborating evidence from cycling experiences. This suggests that the pure lactate development approach relies less on volume than implied by Bakken and the conventional wisdom, though I think we can forgive Bakken who had the elite athlete in mind. It seems the more important factor to reaching one's potential is spending as much time as possible in the 'lactate state', maximising capabilities at LT. Perhaps the hobby jogger with a job and kids has hope, after all? So, in our fixed and limited time available, we do as much volume as we can. It's not 180km a week, but that's ok, we're not trying to win medals. The remaining, and more influential, variable is time spent in the 'lactate state'. How do we know we are in the desired lactate state? In my view the only direct way is measuring the amount of lactate in the blood, with reference to lactate concentration at the anaerobic threshold (which varies between individuals). Heart rate, pace and power at LT may be observed but are ultimately anchored to the lactate measurement. What sticks out (to me) about this 'Norwegian system for hobby joggers', other than the apparent revelation that volume is not essential, is that it involves systematic observations of parameters. Tinman, Jack Daniels, Pfitzinger, all the tables and calculators are based on averages. Instead of assessing performance by 'did I hit the prescribed pace that would put the 18:00 5K runner in the lactate state', its 'did I reach MY lactate state, and is this providing adequate stimulus over time?' Is this an accurate summary? (I spent way too much time writing this)",

I just thought it interesting and fun to share with the thread, particularly for those, if any, who enjoy that component. The reason I brought up the 60-90-150 is, as I stated, several coaches use those paces, approximately. Specifically, I was taking what Tinman provided on a thread once, checking them against what Daniels would predict and discovered they worked out to 60-90-150 minute race efforts. So wanted to share and spark some input/pushback from others. It seems I have and that's good. I wanted to see if people felt there was significance to them any more than 2.5, 3.0, and 4.0 mmol might hold. I agree that they are arbitrary times but times that Tinman stated are approximately associated with the 4.0, 3.0, and 2.5 mmol level. I’m not going to refute someone of his experience and knowledge. I’ll concede that LT1 and LT2, as I used it to relate the low and high end of Tinman’s paces, may not align with what those terms represent in other literature but in relation to what he presented, I thought they were accurate representations and stated the context in which I meant them to be thought of. I’ve read a lot of data that has been reported on runners, including in some cases their lactate curve, by Jack Daniels, Joe Vigil, Brad Hudson, Terence Mahon, Bob Larsen, David Martin, and others. To me, if these physiologists and coaches are defining Aerobic Threshold and Lactate Threshold, which would be the terms I’d use (though perhaps Lactate Threshold and Lactate Turn Point are the current vernacular) and showing data that aligns with roughly a 60 minute and 150 minute effort, I believe them. Again, perhaps it was a semantical issue to use LT1 and LT2 instead of AT and LT, but I have seen LT1 called the aerobic threshold (and defined as approximately 2.5 to 3.0 hour race pace) and LT2 called the lactate threshold (and defined as 60 minute race pace). I don't see that as being confused or uniformed, just perhaps a reflection of environment and sources. Also, no, I am not the spreadsheet guy. That was a legit and resourceful use of Daniels conversion formulas though. Credit to him!",

I think you could also do two workouts per week and a long run. The two workouts can total 30 minutes of work (i.e. 10*3 min, 6*5 min, 3*10 min) and if the long run is done progressively, it’s a very similar stimulus overall. I’m sure most are aware of the study that showed that while running at an easy pace, once the duration reached, I believe around 105 minutes, Type 2a muscle fibers(think intermediate fibers, between slow twitch and fast twitch) were recruited. The same fibers that would be activated/recruited when running in a tempo pace range. So even though the intensity was not at the same level, the duration “forced” the recruitment as Type 1 fibers fatigued. So, from a fiber perspective it has a similar stimulus, even more so if you push the pace down a little toward the end.",

I've said before, I am not a scientist in the slightest , but I do understand I think how to make the most of my training, without getting injured. Cycling was a lot of trial and error, over a long period of time and running has been copying some of that and having the great resource that is KI and his Strava, to double check and even copy whether I'm in the right ball park. It's clearly worked wonders for him on 7-8 hours a week and I'm very happy with my results. Like you say, Bakken and obviously others , usually are at worse describing what optimal training is for sub elites, but it's usually actual elites. So it's about tweaking and moving things, to fit for slower runners or those time crunched. There's obviously debate on the fine tuning of this, going back and forth. But I still stick by what I posted in page 1. The paces I would target if I was doing this with no lactate testing whatsoever. Or , a bit trickier, if you are going to try and run to HR (I find this more difficult) , doing the Job Friel test and basically just targeting his sub threshold zone with the caution being on you don't go over your LTHR. This can be done, but definitely much trickier in the moment, especially the 1k intervals I do regularly. But Either of this options makes it incredible hobby jogger friendly in the initial spirit of this thread, as bar maybe a suggestion I gave someone who was determined to go by HR to go and buy a £15 a HR chest strap, nobody needs to buy anything fancy - and still probably get very close to where they need to be.",

Spoc I think is doing around 6.5-7 hours a week and 35-40 mins work a session X3 a week. And KI about 8 hours a week and he is doing more like 42+ mins work per 3x sessions a week. This is significantly more than 30 mins. Guess what? Their legs didn't fall off after all this time doing this, they could maintain it and they both got fitter. KI is an elite hobby jogger and spoc probably times are better than 98% of letsrun hobby joggers.

I started reading in real time on the first page so I have already done a week training like this. Obviously I have not noticed any difference in performance, but I think someone else mentioned, I feel a purpose. The sessions feel tough, but there doesn't feel like there's the same fatigue next day like a Daniels straight tempo or a vo2 session. It's also great to run easier, on the easy day. It doesn't feel too slow and you can understand WHY you are doing it, with knowing 24 hours later you'll be going again.

LOL There is a thread from 19 years ago, No Interval Work Success, that closely resembles what we are discussing. There’s a lot of good information there, both shared experiences and links to resources. Steve Magness’ The Science of Running, discusses individual variability and gives practical examples of how one can modify training to meet those variations. It’s one of the few mainstream training books on running that I’ve seen do that. I think we all agree, it comes back to training individually, both for your physiology, the event you’re targeting, and life constraints. My take away, when looking at the three different approaches discussed (lactate readings, heart rate percent, and pace as a percent of race pace at another distance) is that they all aim to achieve the same thing and attempt to standardize/communicate it through their respective metrics. Each has validity, but also nuance that as long as the person applying it is aware of allows for a physiological information exchange that is ultimately used to track and assess training and progress. Lactate readings, HR max percent, or the pace as a fraction of vVO2Max are all just metrics through which we have discovered we can measure the stress we imposed by running at a certain intensity for a certain duration.",

But of course, as you say (and Hard2find) we can get very close by using other measures.

I beg to correct myself: aerobic threshold, unless you do a meticulous and systematic check of blood values, varies between 10k race pace and half marathon race pace in runners according to a rule of thumb. That's about 85% of maximum heart rate, roughly speaking (but no more than 90%). A very well trained runner will run close to an hour at aerobic threshold, less good ones can't. If I'm not mistaken, someone who trains low mileage and therefore doesn't favor a marathon or half marathon most of the time because he or she is not optimally trained should do the threshold training in uncomplicated everyday life at about 10k race pace. That sets good training incentives. Anything else would be too slow in that case.",

You are gonna mess about up sometimes anyway, it'll happen. For whatever reason. KI is using pace to guide him and the meter to check on the results of the session, presumably to shape the rest of the week depending on the reading. Unless you test every rep or every other rep. That will happen. But I still think most of the time you'll be absolutely fine, which, in general means you are probably getting almost the most you. n still from this. If you go into lactate threshold or over for 3-4 mins at the end of the last 2 reps, does it matter? Probably not too much if it's just the odd mistake here and there. Is it ideal? No, as in my experience you do actually feel it,even for not very long. As for Froome, well Tean Sky were married to this approach for a while. Wiggins was famous for his sub threshold efforts in his garden shed, hitting specific targets (Tim Kerrison?) that were given to him. He Laos loved TSS and CTL, as a side note. There still needs to be the X factor for the absolute elite, to set them up. When I was cycling and racing for the UK time trial scene, I basically just did all sub threshold to maximise the time I had this was perfect for time trialing. I was and am a horrible road racing. My Anaerobic capacity was shocking and I could probably be beat in terms of power output for a sprint on the trainer, by a lot of random untrained. With Froome, whilst he doesn't need the violent accelerations, he could up the tempo and hold just below his threshold for the long mountains, he does need that range where if he has to follow, he has to follow. Although Geraint Thomas and Wiggins both proved you probably can win the TDF as just an absolute threshold/sub threshold monster in the high mountains, with basically, one pace. 40/20 is the classic cycling session. I have also done 10x1 with float recovery as my X factor session. That's 1 min zone 6 with a minute at low zone 3. Probably the most violet session I've ever done and something that definitely improved my overall package.

As I said, I bet there are guys reading this with zero cycling training who could absolute smash that out of the ball park. They are just totally different systems. I didn't need that real top end power. A diesel engine was all I needed for what I was training for. Froome needed that + a tiny bit of an X factor ( or so he felt or his coaches did).

    "msg": "This was a topic I was just thinking about myself, so glad you asked it! There are a few ways I think about this from a “training system” approach. If you approach training as wanting to recruit and stimulate the spectrum of your muscle fibers, then you would be leaving some fibers behind if you never ran faster than, say 5km pace. Hill repeats are a great method to recruit these extra fibers because they require more force to propel yourself forward, even though the pace isn’t as fast, and thus will recruit more fibers because of that. They also seem to not change your lactate curve by much, if any. Some will refer to this as non-specific lactate work. That is work at a high (relative to the individual runner) lactate reading but that doesn’t result in the deterioration of your lactate curve. Steve Magness has written about this and even produced data on it. I’d assume it’s still on his Science of Running blog. If you’re more of a train the physiological system person, per Daniels, then you can simply think of it as a repetition workout to improve your economy and speed. Daniels doesn’t seem to talk much about bioenergetics and how the different workouts can influence your lactate curve, not that that’s the sole goal of training. He does emphasize that you train like an individual though. How much and how regularly you do different sessions likely just depends on what distance you’re training for and your personal physiology. For 1500m, being able to generate and tolerate those higher levels is certainly a factor. For a marathoner, hills or a-lactic speed work works well, since the goal is largely to shift your LT curve as far out to the right as you can (as well as bring your AT as close to LT too), you don’t want to be countering that with workouts that would do the opposite. I think it all comes back to individuality and balance! This is why most 1500m runners are not the best marathoners and visa versa. Each has a particular physiological make up that lends itself better to different race distances. I identifying that and then training to your specific needs is going to bring you as near your potential as possible. Btw, sirpoc, I agree with the poster who said not to discredit yourself just because you don’t have a science background. You’re providing great insight into your training with relevant metrics, seeking to understand it, keeping an open mind, experimenting and adapting, and improving! That’s the scientific method right there, to me. When I got into running, after a year or two of reading the typical training books and articles, I made an effort to learn the physiology. While I did learn a lot in a technical sense, both biochemically and physiologically, I can honestly say that not a whole lot has changed as far as the structure I use and the workouts I run.
