Only COVID as stopped me in the last 18 months . It's always tempting to be greedy though and increase load, I come up with madcap ideas all the time then stop myself and go back to what I know works. It's easily all overthinked. I did try and make Hard2find run marathon pace 30 mins everyday to see what would happen, but then one never got off the ground ha ha If anyone does try anything a bit more aggressive, would be interesting to hear their medium to long term feedback. This is the contradiction, if I was cycling I have done 5+ of these sessions in a week, when you are quick building after some time off, all at sweetspot (which is what sub threshold is, it's just taken on a new name). But one thing I have really learned, is the demands of running are no joke. Now where there might be something interesting to look into and room for experimentation - is what Jiggy and Shirtboy are up to at the moment, as they are actually incorporating a lot of cycling into their week, to get in quite a bit more work. Early indications, are good, but you still need a decent amount of running on top of that, to keep you a \"runner\" first and foremost. What the balance is, I'm not sure.

To me it seems like people have realized that there's a lot to be gained by running at threshold pace for a few reasons. It's easier on your body to repeat week after week. It provides the most bang for buck of all aerobic training. The workouts themselves are easier to execute as you're never truly straining. Does this sound right? Before anyone ever muttered the phrase \"Norwegian Method\" or \"Double Threshold,\" I experimented with my training after college. I was BAD at \"tempo\" runs in college. We'd do like 3–4 miles @ 5:10-5:30. I blew up so many times. When I could complete them on pace, it was damn near a race effort. After college I trained on my own, and found out that if I ran around 5:50-6:10 pace, I could do that once or twice a week for a tempo run and it was not only easier, it was kind of enjoyable. I didn't even have a GPS watch, my pace was just me guessing based off experience and occasionally doing a few laps of the track in the middle of the run as a pace check. I would go up to 35 minutes doing this, getting in more volume than ever at a \"tempo\" pace. I referred to this as my \"comfortably hard tempo run.\" I went on to set some middle distance PRs incorporating this into my training. I still did some 5k pace work, and of course I did race pace and speed development work too, but I think it was important that these weekly tempo sessions were something I could do over and over again, and get a tiny bit better each week. Did I accidentally stumble into the \"Norwegian Method\"? Was that threshold effort? Was my mind in the right place? Curious what people here might think.",

I don't mean to be a pain , but the paces as a conversion of race speed, would make a huge difference based on shoes, in my experience. Even running 15k pace for 10*1k would be tricky if you ran your race to convert that 15k pace on in vapoflys, versus doing your workouts in something like Pegs (just to use extreme example).",

I always raise a smile every few days when I try and check in on this thread over my morning coffee and they have tried to get a bite of the fishing hook. But, I'm general this thread has been good natured and in the spirit it's intended. The thing that always makes me laugh is when trolls call us \"geeks\" or \"losers\" . As if coming on a running forum is cool in the first place, or as if running is even cool to the general population (spoiler, it's not, they think we are ALL losers 🤣🤣) That's a good question/ point regarding the shoes. But my initial post, I believe still stands as a good guide. Take 1k repeats at 12-15k pace. It was based on my race time, in average carbon shoes (original rocket x) and my workouts were mainly in average carbon shoes (carbon x 3). I'm using faster shoes now, but, proportionally the % of race pace is going to remain the same, the faster shoes just give me a proportional boost in both the workout and the race. I hope that answers your question, but it was actually a good point and shoes are definitely a huge factor here. The narrow sub threshold window we are running in ( if you are using pace as a guide) would be very much affected if you are doing all your workouts in average but comfortable daily trainer, but your race paces coming from elite super shoes. This is where, obviously, absolutely ideally in the best case scenario, you would measure lactate, as they will absolutely tell you where you are, rather than guesstimating for practicality purposes via the use of my pace guides. As remember , there is not actually any real thing as a sub threshold pace, it's just a mixture of different paces and combinations of times that get you into a sub lactate state. The only thing that can actually tell you 100% for sure is the lactate meter. It must be noted , however, I haven't really deviated away from the paces I shared originally. I'll do 1k repeats today and I still will be targeting 12-15k pace. I also haven't bothered measuring lactate in a long, long time. I got to the point where 90% of my runs when I tested lactate, were in and around the numbers I wanted to see. So I basically said to myself, that'll do. Saved me the money of buying strips and just accepted if 9/10 runs got me to where I need to be based on following paces, I'm happy with that. As for the podcast. I really don't know why people are that interested in my training. But I have had 3 people message me so far about pods, but unfortunately my laziness to really respond properly or provide a time to do it (this was mostly around Christmas when I was busy) meant nothing every happened, despite the interest. Unlike Hard2find, I'm not that hard to find so I'm sure if anyone is interested they can contact me and we can try and actually arrange something. I won't mention the name, but one of the podders I have a brief chat with over email must have read this thread, but not really understood it. Or probably just briefly saw \"Norwegian\" and started talking Jakob etc. I don't know why, but this still keeps coming up. This is basically closer (in fact it definitely is) to what a British cycling time trialist might do, than to what Jakob does and his weekly schedule with doubles. What I still envisioned all this for, is older ish runners who have a busy life and maybe could run once a day for an hour and slightly longer at the weekend. If I was doing what Jakob was doing or what Bakken suggested via doubles, I would absolutely not be running any of these paces mentioned. Singles.

A bit of context, I am 57 yo and obviously I am not in a phase where I can progress much, but my objective would be to be under 40 min at 60 yo for 10k and under 1h30 on the half. 25 years ago I used a traditional method of training like Tuesday short intervals, Thursday long intervals, and weekend a medium long run, and was happy of the results with a low milage. After 50 yo and many years without any serious training I started again to train and improve up to about 41-42 min for 10k. Then I tried the Easy Interval Method, it was nice for the training but the results in competition were disappointing. I then went to a more Canova inspired method and went back to my level before starting EIM. Then, I read this thread, and thought why not try it (unlike people critizing without trying) as there was enough time before my first competition in March. The advantage for the evaluation of a training method is that I do a serie of 10k races that are more or less the same every year, so beside the weather change I can really compare the results. First race beginning of March: I finish more than 1 min faster than last year (at 57 , on 10K it is very significant). Very happy with the result, and the race went very well, I felt comfortable. The fact that I could run in a small group was an advantage compared to the previous year, so I think let's see what it will be on next race. The next race was yesterday. But the conditions were very different than last year. Last year the temperature was 9C (48F) and yesterday 24C (75F). Also yesterday it was the first day of the year that it was warm so no possible to get used to the warmth before. Because of this, I was not optimistic to do a good performance. Nevertheless, I finished 20 sec faster than last year when many people finished 1 min slower than last year. So, that confirms IMO the result from the first race. Conclusion: it seems that the method works well for me, even at an old age with many years of training behind. My training: I use the 3 following workouts: 10 x 3 min rest 1 min, 5 x 6 min rest 1min30, 3 x 10 min rest 2 min. 1 rest day per week on average (sometimes 2 and sometimes more when on holidays...)

I do once a week either a medium long run (1h30) or long run (2h) but not more than 2h as I don't run marathons anymore. And that is slow pace as well, except if I try to combine it with like the 3 x 10 min.
