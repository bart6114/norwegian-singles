But the idea instead might be to go from 1 to 2 interval sessions (or even 3) with the bulk of them being sub-threshold. Now you have added more quality running to your 35 -40mpw (it should go up a bit with this added workout), and you should be able to handle it because the intensity will be somewhat reduced.

FF to today and everything I run now is 500m and the thresh pace is 6:30 and a subthresh about 7:10. I alternate fast/slow days by making fast days mostly thresh pace and slow days almost all sub-thresh pace - same distance and reps every day. I can feel like crap some slow days and have never had a fast day that gave me a problem (other than some minor injuries). I also now generally recover in about 30s but I still take the full 60s as a rest. No more sucking wind for any thresh intervals. In the beginning was doing about 30 mpw now up to 60 mpw (some of that is walking). My resting pulse has also dropped from 56 to 50 over that time period.

However I think (provided you notice some improvements in your threshold workouts or in your races) just gradually doing your workouts faster will keep on providing the needed stimulus. so for example Sirpoc does more km per session just because his 10x1k or 6x1.6k has improved basically each month. It is also a good point that as your aerobic capacity improve you should also be able to do longer (timewise) threshold workouts, so if you have time I guess you can go up to 11x1k , 12x1k etc.. Again I don't really follow that model but my usual 3x3k sesssion has now morphed into a 4x3k. But if you have only 1h to spend for each session, just doing them faster gradually like sirpoc does seem to be the way ? I don't think there is a limit to how much threshold/sub threshold work can be beneficial for you but certainly if someone is able to reach 3x15km of threshold work per week consistently I think it means he is pretty fast and able to reach very good results in competition already.",

In a study they were a part of conducted by their physiologist (Leif Inge Tjelta?) their father was quoted as saying they spent their younger years focused predominantly on their aerobic capacity with very limited anaerobic intervals/running. If you follow the development of KI, he has done the same, basically maximizing his MLSS/60 min/Half Marathon race pace and after now only having very slight improvements, he is incorporating the next step: anaerobic training. I think sirpoc (without the injury) may begin to realize he could also take this step if he wants his 5k to keep improving (not very necessary for the half marathon though, if that's his main focus). The important thing to notice is how long KI spent on his aerobic capacity before all of a sudden he was able to do some pretty intense training (I remember seeing something like 20x300m hills in the last few months). Anyways, that's my 2 cents to keep the conversation going. I know it's not \"threshold singles\" focused, but I do think it applies to anyone who does this method and finds they stagnate after a while (I also think this is related to the idea of a lydiard base \"as long as possible\" before very intense training)",

We should be worrying what they are doing, not what double systems Bakken recommends for elites or what Jakob is running on running twice a day. Unless you are elite yourself, which is virtually nobody on Letsrun. If you look at sirpoc runs on Strava, we pretty much know what his LTHR is at this point. He's stimulating that from below and maybe by the end of the last rep is almost touching that. Maybe you only get 95% of the benefit of a threshold run, but the fact is as a hobby jogger he can then do that 3x a week because it is so planned and controlled despite clearly being a slave to a watch and boring. Maybe he could fit 2 full threshold runs in Daniels style, but he'd almost certainly be wrecked and overall he has got less stimulus. So it wouldn't make sense to do that. Long term the three slightly less intense runs are worth more than the two at a higher intensity. In my mind, this whole thing is basically as simple as that. For those who are interested , I've been following this thread and the progress on Strava of others in the group closely, the key take from this is that those who understand what is going on here under the hood, have made fantastic progress. The problems seem to be where people tweak it a bit or don't quite understand it in the first place, maybe they do but also over complicate it. I'm one of the many who have had fantastic success on singles doing this, I have just come down from 37 to a low 34 on my first 10k of the season. I am 42 now so I assumed by PB days were firmly in the past, considering I've been running 10 years and that PB was 8 years ago. The posts sirpoc posted on page 1 here I think stand up remarkably well, even probably nearly a year on. I don't really think he has even tweaked a huge amount himself.

But even with this I was good to go sub threshold by the Tuesday. In the race at about 20 miles for the first time ever I still felt strong.

The most recent k reps finished in 3:10. That is his 5k PR pace.

This also means there are no surprises when racing. So I would be shocked if he doesn't already know he is probably in PB shape right now, especially for 10k and up. I know on LRC we laugh at prediction workouts, but if you can run 10*1k on 1 min rest and stay under Lthr even right up to the end in 3:16 average, you clearly are going to have a great shot at sub 33 for a 10k.

The endurance component is very important in helping to establish the metabolic infrastructure for efficient aerobic and glycolytic processes. So to the extent that infrastructure is develop, your potential for effective lactate processing at high intensity efforts is compromised. So, I'm not sure you can continue to have an optimal rate development with this kind of programming without progressively higher volumes of aerobic development. From what I understand of how the coaches in Norway are starting thier younger runners on this method, they don't start with doubles until it's necessary to manage the increased training volume. If you've read Bakken's post on the Norwegian Method, the doiuble threshold was in response to breaking up necessary threshold training volume in to manageable workouts. Thus instead of doing a 20k tempo runs, he did two 10k volume threshold intervals with a restricted range of pace effort.

    "msg": "It's been over a year now since I started taking lactate samples. I have accumulated over a 100 samples from runs since, and a few more from stationary rides when I got injured recently. I'll keep this about running though. This become long, depending on how much I feel on rambling, so I'll add a TL,DR at the footnote of the post. Establish whether the relationship between heart rate [HR] and lactate values is strong enough (good correlation) to use it as a primary gauge for lactate-orientated training. Samples were taking by a Lactate Plus meter. Heart rate was recorded via Garmin HRM-Pro Plus chest strap. I categorized my samples into three color codes. 1- Green, which means I'm confident about the sample reading being correct. 2- Yellow, which means I'm uncertain and it might be contaminated. 3- Red, which means I'm certain the reading is wrong. A total of samples fall into the yellow category, while samples are red. That leaves samples in the green category. I also state whether the samples was taking indoor on the treadmill, or outside. The list sheet contains rows for each samples, in which the Rep distance/Rep duration/Avg Pace/Avg HR/ Max HR/Temperature/Relative Humidity/Feels Like index/Incline are also logged. Comparing the two parameters is done by plotting average heart rate on the X-axis versus lactate values on the Y-axis which is the basis for a linear regression model. The R squared coefficient is then calculated. This coefficient of determination runs from , which means there is absolutely no correlation whatsoever between the two parameters, to , which means the variance in the model can be completely explained by one of the parameters. Six sets of samples were taken into account when plotting the regression model and the subsequent correlation comparisons: Set #1: All green samples only. Set #2: All green + yellow samples. Set #3: Indoor green samples only. Set #4: Outdoor green samples only. Set #5: Indoor green + yellow samples. Set #6: Outdoor green + yellow samples. Red samples have been omitted from any analysis that affects the next section. A total of samples were taken outside, with the other samples being indoors on the treadmill. One thing to note is that 6 out of 7 red samples fall into the outside category, illustrating how sweat contamination/poor sampling technique is more prevalent outside versus inside. Set #1 coefficient is = . Set #2 coefficient is = . Set #3 coefficient is = . Set #4 coefficient is = . Set #5 coefficient is = . Set #6 coefficient is = . I have to preface by saying this is a N = 1 experiment, but I tried to keep things repeatable and thus give myself the best chance of meaningful data and thus meaningful models. I also must mention that such an analysis has limitations. I won't go into much detail about all that. Other limitations include the sampling size, which is on the lower side for smaller subsets such as \"Outdoor green samples only\". The first set has a correlation of 0.5212, which suggests that around of the variability observed in the target variable is explained by the linear regression model. In comparison, the R square coefficient drops down to 0.421 when including the yellow samples into the mix. In this case, approximately of the variance is explained by one of the model parameters, making it even less correlated. The correlation goes slightly up a few percent when we look at set #3 where the about of the variance is explained. However, the correlations go down significantly when we start looking at sets 4, 5 and 6, where the range is . Lactate levels at any HR seemed to be considerably lower on the treadmill vs outside. Secondly, even when comparing identical workouts on the treadmill in different times of the year, I could have a differential of at an identical heart rate, even when controlling for pace and weather. Case study: I compared a 6 x 1K workout done on the same treadmill. Workout #1 took place in October 2023 when I was in peak shape tapering for my HM in the middle of the month. I tested lactate after the last rep and it was at 3:47 min/km pace with an average heart rate of and a maximum heart rate of . Workout #2 took place in March 2024, after an extended break from running (4 weeks off in February, only biking on a smart trainer and strength training). Again, I tested lactate after the last rep and this time I got at 3:48 min/km pace, despite having an average heart rate of and a maximum heart rate of . These two workouts were in almost identical conditions (24.3 vs 23.4 Celsius, 44.5% vs 47% RH, respectively). The only difference is that the treadmill was set to an incline of 0.5% during workout #2. The difference between the two lactate readings is quiet significant. If I had chosen to train by a pre-set HR target on the first workout, I would have probably ended up running too hard/fast. I have other examples on how much the lactate/HR can drift apart under constant HR, but for simplicity and repeatability, I only showcased the 6 x 1K treadmill workout. I made the same observation for outdoor workouts. In this ( ) experiment of comparing lactate with heart rate, my experience suggests that there exists a HR/lactate decoupling effect, where the two can be significantly uncorrelated. As it stands though, training by a set heart rate inferred from a certain protocol might not be suitable in certain conditions ( ). Values obtained from the treadmill do not always transfer well into the outdoor realm as well. One must take into account all these variables and control for them for a meaningful target. If the desired outcome in a threshold workout is a specific lactate value, there is no going around the fact that a lactate meter is the way to go. Lactate values can be skewed to multiple reasons, including nutrition. More testing over a longer period will give a better insight about the behavior of the different subset models. I took over a 100 lactate samples over the past year in different settings and compared them to HR. The relationship between HR and lactate is to establish a set target HR for training the training is lactated-based (i.e., the goal is to hit a specific lactate value).",

This is incredibly helpful for those who are weighing up the option of going pace or HR when a meter is not possible. Sirpoc originally said, lactate testing is best which is quite the obvious answer, but pace is a better indication than HR. I was skeptical of this, but I have come absolutely full circle to 100% agree with rgis. The advantage of pace being that you can run the same route each week. If it's flat, even better. Even better still, run on a track. I suspect pace, as sirpoc posted a long time back, will not always work , but it'll get you where you want to be of the time, or at least closer than going by HR will. His unbelievable progression, with you confirming now he hasn't used lactate testing for a while, is testament to that pace is almost certainly the clear winner if it's a straight choice between pace or HR. Of course lactate testing is best, but it is certainly not practical for everyone. Especially if you run outside and not on a track. I don't think this thread has all the answers, or that any of the main contributers would say they do, but it likely provides the average/above talented runner the absolute best opportunity to reach their potential , or as close to it as you can get, with the least risk. I've been training like this since October now and have made a big jump from mid 18s in the last 5 seasons to a low 17 in the start of the summer 5k races. I'm 44 so I couldn't be happier as I just assumed the chance to ever break 18 was gone a few years ago. I've been trying to get a couple of my local clubs teammates to adopt this training, but their old skool mentality just can't bring them to. Which is a shame, we could do with the extra points and we might even win this year's team series! However, the thought of no 5k pace work has them baulking at the postposition. Yet my 1+ minute PB they can't seem to correlate I wouldn't have probably got, had I not adopted this method.

Isn't it the whole concept of threshold?? so yeah I mean if you want your training to be what you call \"lactate based\" HR will of course be a different indicator but why on earth would you want your training to be lactate based at this level of performance ? I thought this was a thread for time-crunched hobby joggers. if you want to hit sub-threshold you just have to be careful around not hitting too close to your threshold heart rate if you just use pace, it is guaranteed on a windy or hot day if you have preexisiting fatigue you will overshoot the threshold but tbh that is fine too so I wouldn't be 100% set on hitting a prescribed pace, you can be flexible around it. of course the best is keep doing what works for you so adding lactate reading can probably improve your precision around the threshold.

Yes, but this analysis was not accounting for intensity, just lactate vs average heart rate. The exponential curve you talk about is a different topic. Also, no, that small change in heart rate should not result in that big of a change in lactate. 1.6 mmol/L differential within few BPM is not normal, especially when it is clearly a sub threshold effort. I have an another example for you: Workout A = 5 x 1.6 k and workout B = 6 x 1.6 k) on the same route. Workout A took place on the 14th of June with in 37.2 C & 48% RH (feels-like 44.4 deg C). Workout B took place on the 4th of October in 32.2 C & 67% RH (feels-like 39.4 deg C). While the weather was not so much better in the second workout, I still think it provides some value. In workout A, I tested for lactate after all reps except the third, which is exactly the opposite in the workout B, where I only tested lactate after the third. The second rep that workout A was @ 4:30/km average with HR of 171 and Max of 177, lactate = 2.2 mmol/L Fourth rep that day was @ 4:27/km with HR of 183 and Max of 188, lactate = 3.1 mmol/L Whereas in workout B the third rep was @ 3:57/km average with HR of 170 and Max 176, lactate = 3.6 mmol/L Just in case anyone has trouble following this wall of text, here's table format to summarize the difference: 171 4:30/km 2.2 170 3:57/km 3.1 So you can see, despite running at a higher HR in workout A, lactate was lower due to the slower paces. LTHR is a good approximation, but you could under/over shoot when running by it, especially so in challenging conditions. You could approach and be at LTHR, but a lactate test would reveal that you're still not at threshold. Conversely, you could run too fast in good conditions at LTHR, and end up with a higher lactate level than desired. Well, even time-crunched runners have a 60 second window for a lactate test ;) To each their own, I would never argue that any of this is necessary for improving performance, but understanding what works is definitely beneficial for efficient training.",

    "msg": "I really like 60-90s reps on short recovery, and I think it has some unique advantages over longer slower reps, but I also think it makes sense for a lot of people to hold off on that style of work. It's one of the most challenging workout schemes to execute correctly. A lot of people are underdeveloped enough aerobically that they can still make incredible progress with easier-to-execute workouts in the more familiar threshold to sub-threshold effort range, so it's just not yet worth the skill development effort and risk of overreaching to take on the more difficult to execute workout. The whole philosophy discussed in this thread basically boils down to just to doing the easiest workouts that will still give you some progress so that you can do the most of those workouts and get the most progress in the safest and most sustainable way.",

    "msg": "Ik this thread is about doing single thresholds. But I have been doing double threshold for quite a while and still thought this was relevant about the 400m intervals. Firstly I think the 400m efforts should 100% be done on the treadmill. You don't have to control pace and once you have done it once or twice you know exactly what you need to aim for. You can then progress it gradually as your other workouts get easier. Secondly, the 400m efforts are a totally different stimulus to the 3min, 6 min and 12 min efforts. If you're doing only 3 thresholds a week then it would make a lot more sense to cut out the 400s because it's highly likely to be the session where you spend the least time at the beneficial threshold zone you are targeting. Whereas if you are doubling and then do an easier session on the Saturday, you have slightly more time to add this workout in. I do it as a Tuesday PM workout after 5 x 6 mins in the morning.",
