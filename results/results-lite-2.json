But 99% of us are hobby joggers. You are right, it is quite boring. I actually listen to a lot of podcasts and stuff and just dial in on my easy runs and focus on the pace and nothing else on the sun threshold runs. Telling myself, no matter what, stick to this narrow pace zone on my Garmin. It's hard, some days I could clearly do more. But have to remind myself, this has to be done again in 48 hours. As a small aside, there's a lovely mile waterside running stretch where I live, that I tend to do intervals on. Or even just easy runs. You'd be amazed at how many people I probably have 1-2 mins on in my local parkrun, come tearing past me. I had a conversation with a guy the other week, at parkrun. He said oh \"I saw you out on my easy steady state run the other day, I came past\". I was doing like 5:05 per km and he came tearing past me like I was standing still. I think he's like high 19 low 20 for the 5k. I explained to him I was also on my normal run, I run that pace like 4 days a week. He genuinely was baffled and thought I was joking.

    "msg": "This touches on two topics that resonate, keeping easy runs easy and burning out on intervals. I see a lot of training articles (not just from magazines but from physiologists and coaches) that define easy pace as 1:30 - 2:00 per mile slower than 5K race pace. To me, that's moderate and not a pace to be targeted as your normal easy pace if running regular sessions, say 2-3 per week. Research (and better still, accumulated experience) points to being able to run at a much lower intensity on easy days and still accrue all the benefits. If you're not doing regular sessions, I think you can run in this moderate pace range daily, but the fitness you'll reach will not be as high (specifically for racing) as if you are doing 2-3 threshold sessions and 3-4 easy runs per week. I really agree with your last point. Both personal experience and observed leave me perplexed as to why VO2 Max intervals are done in such high volume (and in some cases regularity) for \"amateur\" athletes when threshold work has shown it's both sustainable and delivers the athlete to near peak performance. Easy runs and regular threshold work (but not where you are regularly at and/or exceeding LT, call it 4 mmol but that can vary by individual) really do a fantastic job of getting you most of the way to your potential. As a personal anecdote, I was someone for who more than 2-3 VO2 Max interval sessions in as many weeks time would start to erode my fitness and more importantly, my performance. I briefly had a coach when I was in my early twenties who assigned me 2 VO2 Max sessions per week for a four week block leading into a 5km race. I started to feel like I was regressing in the third week and a week after the race, I was absolutely trashed. To the point I developed CNS fatigue and took 4-6 weeks of just rest and easy runs to get back to feeling normal. Also, like others on this thread have expressed and even in Marius Bakken's writings, there is what I consider an adaptive threshold where more threshold in a session or more in a week through greater regularity, will not result in any performance increase. I do think 2-3 per week with at least one easy day in between is the way to go.",

If you're wanting to follow the \"Norwegian\" outline: Sun - Easy Mon - Tempo Tue - Easy Wed - Tempo Thu - Easy Fri- Repetitions Sat - Long Run If in your warm up for the two tempo sessions you do 8*100m strides, that's two sessions of strides there. The repetition workout is essentially a stride workout, so far as pace goes (assuming it is done at approximately 1500m pace) although if the repetitions are longer and/or the total volume is high, the physiological impact can be different than a basic leg speed session. I think a lot has to do with how you define these different training philosophies. For example, if you just think of the Norwegian System as emphasizing threshold workouts then whether you use the first template or the second, you're training using the Norwegian System. This is nothing new to be honest as runners have been using these outlines for years. I think what gives the Norwegian System it's novelty is 1) the regular utilization and analysis of lactate readings and using lactate values (or efforts) that are lower than the traditional LT as popularized by Daniels and others here in the US as 60 minute race pace or 4.0 mmol and 2) the redundancy in the workouts used. This even goes against some coaches suggestions on never repeating the same workout or always progressing the workout so as to modulate the training load. I personally think consistency over many weeks, say 18-24, and then just repeated for each build-up is better than the really intense workouts that are progressed toward at the end of most runners' training plans in order to illicit a big stimulus and \"peak\" them.

The only rationale for this is there's a point where I saw Jacobs hobby jogger brother increase volume a bit, the odd extra rep here and there and he kept the overall rough 80/20 ish (more like 75/25) time in zone to the same ratio by then just making the easy days slightly longer.

I think some of these metrics and different ways of quantifying training are interesting but, I agree with lexel, they are just mathematical values to assign to what we as runners already know intuitively. Interestingly, I remembered reading a thread from years ago where Tinman posted the following: A 3 mile run at 25-30 seconds per mile slower than your 5km pace. A 6 mile run at 60-70 seconds per mile slower than your 5km race pace. A 12 mile run at 2-2:30 per mile slower than your 5km race pace. They are about equal in aerobic stimulus stress on your body, but the 12 mile run is more trauma, impact stress. If you have an LT pace of 6:00 per mile and compare what Tinman is saying (and what a lot of us know from training experience) to what the rTSS score suggests, running 54 minutes at 6:00 per mile would achieve the same score as running for 96 minutes at 8:00 per mile.

For those who use the PMC it's incredibly useful, but I think someone mentioned, it doesn't really serve a purpose for anyone but yourself. It tells me more about my body than feel. I use Friels heart rate TSS, I don't personally find it far off. I train up to and for 10 mile races, as this is probably the limiting distance of TSS for runners. I can get close to 100 on that 10 mile race, roughly an hour. My easy runs are top end of zone 1 HR, to get to 100 TSS I'd have to run 2.5 hours. Id rather do the 10 miler, if fine that easier. So it's swings and roundabouts it can work both ways, as some of the outlier examples others have used. I think it gets complicated with those who are very aerobically trained for long distances. People are always arguing about the merits of TSS, CTL and the merits of the PMC. Maybe everyone is digging into the weeds a bit too much. In general, I think it must have some use when talking about this model, as in general it seems everyone who has improved in this thread, with or without knowing it would have increased their weekly TSS.

Its ok sirpoc if it works for you, but i had to mentioned that and i didn't want to attack you, far away from it. If an artificial intelligence would calculate such a stress value per week, how would it operate? Most likely it would define zones and provide some scale factors to it. The TRIMP or modified TRIMP system tries to do that. Polar uses Trimp since decades. It workes for me and i think it is better than TSS. What is debatable is, if it is better to do 30min at 95%FTP, or 45min at 90%FTP as an example. Only if you have different scale factors within those intensities you find a solution, otherwise the higher duration provides a higher stress, if the scale factor is the same in this range.

I have normally thought of this as the classic case of being underdeveloped aerobically (think the examples from the HADD thread). In fact, going back to my remark regarding the rTSS scores. While it would be silly to suggest 54 minutes at LT is equivalent to 96 minutes at 67% of LT (as a 90 rTSS score suggests), you can flip it and say rather than killing yourself and doing 54 minutes at LT, you can run 96 minutes at a 1.33 multiple of LT and yield the same rTSS. Which in a sense is what you did when riding those 2.5 hours in Zone 2! As lexel pointed out, I think the debate has long been and continues to be what percent of LT can you do and still yield optimal/productive results for race performance. I personally find that somewhere between what is half marathon pace and marathon pace for me seems to be the \"sweet spot\" but I also try and do 45-60 minutes of that in a session (once I've built up to that of course).

But I'm quite enjoying that there are actually other runners out there who maybe think outside the box and want to apply this sort of thing to hobby joggers like us lol First of all, it's remembering that TSS/ training load was originally done for power, as that is what Coggan was obsessed with. I didn't realise he still posts, but he is still to this day regularly posting on the \"time Trialling forum\", I linked him literally trolling the forum a few pages back . Like I said, he's a strange man. But I do still think there probably isn't anything better, I agree with the poster last night . I'm on UK time so I was fast asleep by then. This bit is specifically as a bit of an aside for those who maybe don't like TSS, CTL and the metrics. But if you go to those forums and search, there's a user \"Tarmac Expert\" who is probably the single greatest Time Trialist pound for pound, maybe ever. In the sense the times he did, on the absolute lack of talent he had, are unbelievable. Even into his 40s. His real name is Steve Irwin (everyone lol) but he's almost certainly a genius. He got (don't know if he's still riding) the absolute maximum out of what he had. To a point I've never seen before. Some technical, but from a physiological aspect, he was indexing his training against his CTL and then could index that to his fitness. It was very clear it was applicable (to him) I did the same and so on. Here's the thing , he HATED/HATES Coggan . So if anyone was going to hate on CTL, it was this guy. A standalone ride/run with a TSS score means absolutely nothing. But if you have years of data over time and you are sure that data is collected correcting (updating zones all the time) you will start to see patterns in the data you can use. Is it perfect? No. But again I don't think there is anything better. If Hard2find wants to try something better for running , I'd be interested! One side note, I just re evaluated all my runs (took a while, but had breakfast whilst it was doing it) from around the last 18 months. Changed TSS calculation from pace, to HR. This changed a lot of the individual runs in isolation, but overall the CTL Curve remained the same and showed a steady increase and it's around the same number as now. Obviously, that number means nothing to anyone but me. But whilst a few runs have changed their TSS value, it works both ways, some were TSS heavy in some areas via one method or the other, others the opposite. The point being it's not perfect, but over a long time it all evened out in the end. I can still plot along that graph, points where my fitness increased and marry that up to by PBs in the last year, with both calculations. Going back full circle, the question Lexel posed about which is better, 95% of FTP for 30 mins and 90% for 45 mins, I would say it's almost certainly the 45 min run/ride, the sport isn't important. There is still enough happening at 90% that is pushing up your lactate from below that there is at 95%. I also agree with what (I think it was the same guy added) is the better example is probably 90% or 100%. The 100% run as an absolute stand alone , single event, is obviously harder and for that one session you are getting probably a slightly better stimulus. But good luck doing that, every other day. You might be able to for a even a few weeks. But over a long time. Absolutely no chance. Whereas the whole point of this thread, is nobody doing this is running at 100% FTP/LTHR or however you want to put it, every other day. But quite a few people now as well as myself , that running at under that threshold but close to it, is doable 3 times a week and over a vast period of time, with almost no break or breakdown in the body or performance, in face the opposite, performance seems to be increasing. In pure simplistic terms, it's the systematic increase of load on the body in small drips from a tap, rather than turning on the tap full blast and trying to fill the cup in a short space of time, like a lot of other training plans. If I had 8 weeks to get fit, there's probably much better ways to do it. If I wanted a real long term goal in fitness that is measurable most weeks, this is definitely the most sensible way, IMO .",

If you start out the reps and try and keep the pace the same and after the first one you are nearer 153-155 by the end, you probably will keep the whole lot under. I've not really tried to do this, but you could experiment. Just looking at my runs, my LTHR is 175, I'm usually in the mid to high 160s by the end of the first couple, and the low 170s by the end of the 5th. Definitely don't start out too hard, what you don't want to do is go too far over your LTHR. It defeats the purpose. I posted way back on another page, but I purposely once went over by upping the pace in the last rep, spent almost 6 mins which doesn't seem like a lot, but I was trashed the next day compared to what I usually am. I couldn't have done that 3 times that week. So it's a fine balancing act, very controlled, very measured, as others have said, very boring. Side note: you just wouldn't be able to control anything under 1km by heart rate. I've never tried but I don't see how you could really. Someone might be able to correct me on that. Even at 1k it might be tricky.",

We all have a maximum genetic potential which we can ascend to (even if that means we are 10, 20, 50 percent slower than the world record for the distance we race).

Takes a while to dial a pace in that you can do the entire session and not exceed the ceiling, but when you do you pretty much do not even need the lactate readings anymore and you can completely know by HR. This of course means your workout cannot start hot. That HR will drift slightly during the session.

I think any one who makes the effort to quantify training and present it in an actionable and understandable way for athletes in their pursuit of performance improvement is undeserving of harsh criticism in regard to the derivation of the metrics they use, as ANY modeling is going to come with compromises and incompleteness, to a degree, so I don't want to at all give the impression I thought or think these metrics useless. The ATL and CTL are both weighted moving average models, which basically is just saying it gives more emphasis to your more recent runs than runs in the past but that runs in the past do contribute to your overall fitness, but at a diminishing fraction the further in the past they were performed. Both the ATL and CTL are derived from the TSS score though. This, to me, is where the nuance and personal interest comes in. Specifically how you can achieve the same score with a totally different training intensity distribution. Conventional theory would suggest you need to do race specific workouts to run your best times but based on this model you could, in theory, reach similar metrics without such workouts and just emphasizing volume. It sounds like what you said you did with the 2.5 hour rides in Zone 2 spiroc, before riding a 10 mile TT PR. Personally, what I wanted to do, and to some degree but with less enthusiasm than a decade earlier (LOL), still want to do, is design a system that works to bring a runner to their, what I would call \"adaptive threshold\" given time constraints for training but also measuring adaptive response to specific workouts.

There was a great thread I've been looking for where \"tarmac expert\" the guy I mentioned before, on the time Trialling forum, indexed his CTL to knowing what his power output would be, no matter really how he got there. It was even closer than mine. When I realised this after a few years of cycling, I was just doing less and less training to get my CTL number as high as I could. It worked. The interesting thing about when I was injured and had a broken collarbone as well as shoulder blade, was I wasn't even trying to do anything. I was just bored for 6 weeks and watched a couple of movies a day in front of the TV and rode the bike everyday in the hope I wouldn't be horrible when I could finally go outside again. Bradley Wiggins whilst a quote controversial character, was also a big fan of looking at TSS per session and CTL. Lexel mentioned TRIMPS, which you can also use on golden cheetah, but ultimately again what we are all talking about is roughly the same, is we are measuring or trying to explain why this works. Ultimately, whatever metrics you use, the takeaway seems to be doing 3 sub threshold sessions a week is probably creating a greater load than anything else you can do and maintain, over a long period of time.

Nobody can say the exact paces without lactate. The paces lexel mentioned are what Norwegian system says to do them in doubles, 2 double sessions for week + hills. Spoc, Kristoffer the hobby brother to Jacob, they are pushing a little harder as it's only one session a day, to really get to limit to lactate to be able to do a single session again 48 hours later. It's just doing the most you can handle, without crushing yourself. Doubles, you can't handle 2 X Close to 3.5 mmol , so you do first session definitely under, like Lexel says they do, maybe 2 mmol, then they push a bit more on the second maybe just above 3. Overall more stimulus by far than one hobby jogger session. But hobby jogger goal is to fill that one session maybe even above 3, but not bust and can still carry on later in the week.

Joking aside, I think we know we‚Äôre ultimately an experiment of one. For me, I started on the ‚Äúclassic‚Äù 1 long run, 1 tempo run, 1 interval, and 3-4 easy runs template. This worked of course as I was starting out, but I plateaued. I tried adding more volume but always found the interval session seemed to beat me up and zap my stamina. I have tried higher mileage and two interval sessions a week, lower mileage and two interval sessions a week, higher and lower mileage with just one interval session a week‚Ä¶ all permutations lead to, what I felt were, below optimal results. This, along with curiosity and a desire to optimize my time spent training, lead me to adopt a 2-3 tempo sessions per week approach. I have really detailed data on all my training and checked this so that I‚Äôm not just idealizing what I did. The first time I used this approach, in 2017, for a 24 week period, I averaged 10.5 hours per week of running, with a high of 12 hours and a low of 7.5 hours. As a side note, this was and is my highest ever, I since have stopped running doubles and aim for 9-10 hours in singles for 7 days or 8-9 hours if running 6 days per week. During that time I ran 2-3 tempo sessions per week (if I did 3, I included it in the long run for that week). The sessions were very basic and consistent, 12*1km w/ 200m, 6*2km w/ 400m, 4*3km w/ 600m, 3*4km w/ 800m. My HR_Max is 195 (tested, not guessed) so it‚Äôs pretty easy to know where I am as a 5% change is almost exactly 10 bpm. On those workouts, my HR never exceeded 90% HR_Max and basically stayed in the range of 80%-85% HR_Max. Part of this, I believe, was due to the volume I was running, as well as the fact these were in interval form. I find that if I can get to running 75-90 minutes average per day run, this gets me to the same fitness as if I average more, say 90-105 minutes, which I was doing during that time for some weeks. On 60 minutes average per day run, I know I have a little more fitness to squeeze out of myself, but I‚Äôm not far off from my best on that volume, particularly at 5km. For some performance specifics, I ran a 10km time trial as fast as I ran a 10km race a year earlier and did it at 88% of HR_Max! When I ran the 10km race I ran a PR and did it at 94% of HR_Max (about 10 days after running the time trial). I also have other data, from testing, that shows even when I maintain volume if I start doing VO2 Max intervals, after just a few weeks, my performance declines. Also, if I drop the volume of my threshold sessions to 30 minutes, twice per week, at LT (instead of a little slower) my fitness is not as high as when I did 48 minutes at slightly slower than LT. I know most aren‚Äôt likely interested in this level of minutia but as others have said, trying to get the most out of our training given time constraints and other obligations is the goal for us amateurs. Knowing we are doing that, at least for me, is a satisfying feeling and makes the training all the more fulfilling.

Then power measurement came up in cycling and later the %FTP stuff. Everyone was talking the same language, and efforts got comparable and measurable. This was some kind of game changer, and the communication between athletes and coaches got better. Cycling is now way ahead of running. %CV for runners can be a replacement to %FTP for cylists (no it's not the same), maybe it's even better and the efforts can get comparable. I did 30min@85%CV (as an example), that has to be the language we communicate!",

Or with x%CV i stay at my lactate baseline for 60minutes. And then there can be discussion like: i have more success doing 45min@%85CV compared to 30min@90%CV (again example).

    "msg": "I should have specified, but my reference to LT was if LT is defined as 60 minute race pace, not necessarily 4 mmol/L of blood lactate. vVO2 could be 10 minute race pace, vCV could be 30 minute race pace, and vLT 60 minute race pace. Maybe vVO2 is closer to 8 minutes, maybe vCV is closer to 35, for example but the pace you could hold for those few minutes shorter or longer is not as varied as the pace people run when someone associates LT to your half marathon pace or CV to your 10K. I agree there is too much variety in blood lactate readings to suggest singular figures to train at. I think most people who engage in these topics understand, as with most any data collection, there's going to be a distribution about a mean. I also think we sometimes go too far in the weeds about trying to illicit detail or reinvent how training is done. Jake Wightman beat Jakob Ingebrigsten at last years 1500m and no one, as far as I've observed, is asking how he trains LOL It seems that while physiologists and some of us give thought to the mechanism behind improvement and quantifying it, plenty of coaches and runners are fulfilling their potential with good old trial and error. And to be fair, we really are pretty much all in the same neighborhood of what we are doing.",

    "msg": "I hadn‚Äôt looked back at this thread since initially recommending Kristoffers strava. I assumed it would be the usual misinterpretation and obsession with double threshold. Great thread guys. I think finally people are understanding the true mentality behind ‚ÄúNorwegian‚Äù training. I once heard Jakob say on a podcast (some non running Norwegian company podcast or something) - his goal is to run as many miles as he can, as fast as he can. And he can‚Äôt run fast every day because he will get injured. The goal is essentially to do the most training you can sustain. Id be curious how spoc will progress his training. Kristoffer has very gradually increased volume over time - almost imperceptibly but over years it leads to big changes. One other thing to note- KI was doing some shorter and quicker reps over this past winter, and 1k reps around 3:20. He sustained it but eventually posted that he felt beat up so slowed down a bit and increased the volume. So even Henrik is experimenting with what might work‚Ä¶and tracking it.",

    "msg": "Sustained training, that is the point that we've been emphasizing. Well put! A back of the envelope calculation, but really as much a conceptual idea as metric, could involve using your HR. No, as with any metric, I don't think this is infallible nor precise. Having said that, I think we would all agree that if we ran all our minutes per week at 75% HR_Max, we could sustain that, right? Well if you simply use 75% and multiply that by the total minutes run, you can use that value to track your training, similar to TSS and CTL. For example, if you run 7.5 hours per week, 450*0.75 = 337.5. If you wanted to standardize this just divide by the total number of minutes ran, which in this case will just give you 0.75 since there was only one input. However, using this as a benchmark, you can include different intensities. For example: 90 minutes at 85% HR_Max 180 minutes at 75% HR_Max 180 minutes at 70% HR_Max 90*0.85 + 180*0.75 + 180*0.70 = 76.5 + 135 + 126 = 337.5 337.5/450 = 0.75 So, same total and standardized to 0.75 but with 90 minutes spent at 85% HR_Max, which roughly for most of us probably works out to running between MP and HMP on long intervals. And again, before I get attacked for the pitfalls with this like, what if you run a pace faster than the minimum pace that illicits HR_Max, don't you know HR can vary based on heat, fitness, nutrition, hydration, etc. It's simply a potential way to gauge YOUR training, as the total score and standardized value can vary based on your personal training volume and findings. Of course, I wouldn't suggest it's going to tell you anything you don't already know intuitively.",

I figure with him being a British middle distance guy and from what he was saying about training, his template is more from the Horwill and Coe approach to training than Ingebrigsten. I agree with you as well on the lactate reading, but I do wonder for amateurs or lets say runners not running substantive volume, how they would perform. When I used the meter, I was running 9.5 hours per week in singles, which I would consider substantive. In fact, one summer I even did all my workouts on a treadmill for 12 weeks. Just the two workouts per week, all other runs were outside. I did regular testing and found that 3.0-3.5 mmol was my range for most of these. In order to get to 4.0 I had to put out an effort that felt more like 10km race effort. I often found that once my volume was up and I was doing 40-50 minutes of threshold intervals in a session, the accumulated fatigue made me not even want to try and run any faster than those readings anyway LOL. I found that when I dropped volume a bit to 8 hours per week and dropped the threshold to 3*10 minutes at what was a more intense effort, I got to 3.5-4.0 mmol but lost fitness in my 5*2400m test and a time trial test, which was interesting, to a degree.

I hope you will now accept my Strava request my friend, I see you have many KOMs cyclist (some of your times up mount Teide for amateur insane) still but no for running, I think you discredit yourself I think your potential for running is huge now you have right way to train for you .So it's funny, we have almost one of best hobby UK cyclist time trials in his past copying one of all time hobby jogger in Jacobs brother. I think this is probably something we want to listen and open our ears to. It is relevant to us more than 99% of stuff people talk about and guys like this while not set world records, clearly have wide range of multi sport knowledge to apply to sport in running where coaches are old and crusty and do same way they have for number of years. Lexel, I think maybe you add digging in ground too much. I don't want to cause tension that is not my goal but CV has its flaws, I think your thinking is wanting to have a running metric that works just as well as power. Once we have that all these debates be finished. One thing I learn from cycling now, training so much easier to measure and control. PMC is easy to use and understand over time and I agree you can use the metrics to give an idea where you are. It is not perfect. But now I'm just hobby cyclist over runner he he oh sipoc I would happily pay for your services to set up my position for time trial bike, I hear you are cda field testing master. But that is for another time üòä Hard2find I think in simplistic terms, you are probably along the correct lines with your HR talk. I think it's better than nothing hrTSS works OK. But nothing comes close to power. But that does not mean a user cannot find patterns to index in their own data in the PMC for running. But it's less compatible to others. Although the sessions like spoc and others laid out I think are still maximum way a runner who is just hobby guy will max his potential closely W And yes, in cyclist terms this is time crunched training they say. I mean, you cannot get injured cycling so it's really just for the lazy guys like me . But has a hobby jogger runner, you have to realise life outside exist and strain on the body is a lot. Maybe I should have done this when serious runner, as I got injured to much. Pushed envelope too far and cracked.

So looked at this probably around this time last year and went from there. In that year I've come down to a 17:27 and yesterday a 35:50 , so I think I might be able to dip under 17 soon, especially as the 5k course I do has 3 dead turns (only 5k I've ever fan, but done it like 25 times, which also helps at plotting progress). It's little gains, here and there. There was no big leap apart from the first PB. I had been doing this maybe about 6 weeks and nothing seemed to happen. Then suddenly I pb'd by like 25 seconds out of nowhere. I guess that was my body adapting and then the door opened. I think I mentioned before, if I increase volume I will do it incrementally and proportionally to my 75/25 easy /sub threshold load. So it might be I add on 5 mins to all my easy runs and then that adds on maybe an extra rep somewhere to my sub threshold intervals, in it's most simplistic form. What holds me back I'd time. This week I was at 6 hours 45, maybe I could stretch the whole week to 8, but with life etc that's likely my limit. But that still gives a bit of time to play around with. And to the other guy, ex cyclist - I don't want this thread to be about me. For a number of reasons, but mainly I just happened to be the first one to post up what in doing and I was pretty open I just kind of combined what I already knew from cycling myself and stealing what Kristoffer did/does.
