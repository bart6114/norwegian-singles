What I found out (I used to time trial) is that whatever CTL I got to that I could maximally sustain, my power was the same over 10 or 25 miles (key distances for time Trialists). To pluck an arbitratory number at random , say my 20 min power was 340w at a CTL of 60, it didn't really matter HOW I got there. In the sense I could do that power on a range of 7 or 12 hours a week training. The 7 hours may have been sub threshold sweetspot every other day, or the 12 hours may have been lots of slow riding and some vo2 max stuff in a week. I tried 4-5 different ways to get to that CTL number. Each time my power was almost the same. Applying this to running, I have about 7 hours a week to train. So running as much sub threshold as I can, which gives a very good CTL score compared to say running 6 days, with long run, hills and a workout, means I'm creating more CTL for the same amount of time running the \"hobby jogger\" Norway model. This I think is the reason my times have improved, despite now not doing any proper REALLY hard stuff. I hope this makes sense? It's effectively a running version of what is very popular in cycling, \"sweetspot\" training. In terms of running just at LT pace, of course not. You adjust the pace depending on the length of the reps + rest. So for example 25x400 would be a faster pace, than the other end of the scale , 5x2k. But ultimately you are reaching the same state of sub threshold, just under. Remember threshold is a state, not a pace. That's why it's important to play around (if you can) with a lactate meter first, to get an idea and try to marry it up to the more traditional data you can get after each run. Ideally you would have a lactate meter all the time, but for hobby joggers like me, after a month or so you can probably get to 98% of where you need to be without it. For a pro, that 2% difference is a concern. But for me, I'm OK with that ðŸ˜€",

    "msg": "To the guy above: My CTL hovers around the 58-62 range. Although that number is kind of arbitratory in the sense it's only really relevant to me and how I've defined by pace , to set the training loads. If you do it by HR, it could be different etc. But as I said before, relative to me and how I collect data, I was about the same pbs for a while around the same CTL range. Which was about 50-52. That was on 6.5-7 hours a week. But now, training using the hobby jogger Norway method, I can reach that higher CTL, for the same time training. Everything I've played around with in both sports, suggests all CTL is created roughly equal. So in that sense, I could go back to running more of a classic running approach, ditch the Norway model , get a CTL of say 60 - and be around the same for 5k I am now. The problem being, it would take me more than 7 hours to get there. Maybe 9. I can't quite squeeze that in. So for the hobby jogger with a life outside of running, the Norwegian model probably gives you the best bang for your buck, even outside of doing doubles. Which I suspect is what Kristoffer, the oldest Ingebrigtsten brother, is doing. In terms of sessions. Again, it's pretty simple. 3 easy runs a week. All under 70% of max HR which is usually about 65% of MAS for those who work in paces as well. This will keep you definitely under LT1. Long run, I tend to just keep the same and by the end I'll be almost at the upper limit of that 70% which is the goal. I think the recent studies which was excellent, on the training characteristics of long distance elite runners (2022) had easy characterised as under 70% Max HR. That seems slow. It is slow. Very slow. The rest of the sessions are anything from 25x400 to 3x3k. 25x400 is probably around 98-99% of Tinman's CV. 10x1k is around 12-15k pace. 5x2k is around HM pace. 6x1600 right around 10 mile pace. I run everyday, so it's 3x easy, 1x long at the higher end of the easy boundary and 3x of the above sessions. The only fast stuff I do is are the parkruns. I've gradually improved after a huge stagnation last year and the summer before. Keep chipping time off my 5k pb each month and have for about the last 9 months now. It was around the same for ages. It's not a quick fix, but over time if you stick to it I think most people will improve and I also have felt fresher than I ever have. Also less niggles, I equate that to not doing the really hard and past paces anymore. I try to stick to that to be honest. It keeps it simple and mixes up what the body is running at. The key to this though, is all short rest. 60 seconds for everything but the 400s at 30. But having had the lactate meter for a while, it will all be around 2.5-3.5 mmol. Again, I no longer test. But I tested enough for a good month or so to know it's good enough for me. But I'm a 17 min guy. If I was Jacob, id care enough to do it every session.

The stryd is pretty laughable and the wrist based power on the Garmin is even worse. Until something better comes along, pace seemed to be the best metric that matched up with what the lactate meter was reading. Obviously if you live in the hills, this is gonna suck for you. But there's always the track. I'm lucky, I live by the sea and can do pan flat loops. So pace is very easy to stick to. I get what you mean about pushing it. I have a friend who is much more genetically gifted than me and started training like this and made some gains. But then he was sending me messages like \"felt good on the easy run so pushed it 15-20 seconds per /km faster\". Or \"was feeling so strong! So I did the 10x1k at 8-10k pace!\". This is where it starts to fall down. Obviously at the time it doesn't feel like much, but over time it adds up and you do that every other run and it's no longer sustainable. Then he's like I'm ruined, I can't handle this! Forgetting he was going way too hard. It works, because it creates what I think is the maximum training load, that minimises the risk of getting injured whilst still stimulating Threshold and vo2 max to an extent, by pushing it up from below. I definitely think it's a confidence thing. I think if you are coming from cycling or rowing , it's probably way easier to have the confidence to try this - as it's just not as alien. I think runners panic and see \"why are the easy runs so easy!!\" \"No vo2 max stuff?! What a joke!!\" Or similar. The icing on the cake for Jacob , that extra 2% I mentioned might be the hills. The stuff that pushes that lactate up above 8mmol and above. But for me, for the hobby jobber Kristoffer, just sticking to 3x easy, 3x threshold and a long run will get you very very close to your max potential, with relatively low injury risk and the extra bit of training load overall that will make the difference for your average, time crunched, hobby jogger.",

One other note to make if you are using lactate in a more modified system of singles: You may want to use the lactate to insure you are getting maximal effects from the session rather than thinking of it from a pure intensity control POV. Say if you were doing doubles, you'd want to be pretty tight on the numbers being at or under sessions, but if you were only doing one a day three times a week, you might want to use the lactate to adjust intensity upwards more than you would in a double threshold model. Say creating some guide posts for yourself in a 10x1k workout at halfway: at your 5th K if you are over/under 3.0 mmol, to maintain or to speed up, meter dependent of course.

The purpose of the \"Norwegian system\" is basically to maximize long-term fitness growth, which is some product of duration, intensity, and repeatability in training (over the course of weeks, months, years). While faster-paced, higher-intensity reps and workouts might produce more fitness growth on a per-mile basis, the \"Norwegian system\" basically prioritizes paces around LT because, when the intensity is properly controlled, an athlete can do \"a lot\" more of it in one day than higher intensities, and these paces are extremely unlikely to burn an athlete out, so they can do these sorts of days/sessions for the majority of the year, for many years. Notice that one of the keys to the LT work is to be able to do \"a lot\" of it! To institute it on lower mileage would really be a matter of figuring out how much LT work you could handle in a way that was very repeatable. Start small, control the intensity, and add volume incrementally. However, before you start (especially with double-thresholds), I would strongly recommend the following: 1. Be accustomed to doubling (even if you have to start with 2 x 20 min runs, get used to running twice a day on at least some days) 2. Be strong muscularly (weight/resistance training!) 3.

If you are probably at the 70+ range I would start to think about doubling, but I would do the doubles on the easy days. So like 2x 45 min runs a couple of days. Then maybe (as I've seen Jacobs hobby jogger bro so), stick to 3 sub threshold sessions but add extra reps on. For instance I've seen him do 12x1k or he quite regularly does 4x3 k, whereas I'm doing 3x3k. This would take me up to maybe 65-70 miles and I'm still not in threshold double range, although a couple of easy runs. Doubles definitely help, I just don't have time. The most insane fitness I ever had on a bike was when I was riding doubles. I would do sweetspot on a bike twice a day on my commute and hour home and then same again back. I didn't know it really at the time, but I guess I was doing early Norwegian training almost by accident. I'm glad people find this useful. I'm not saying it's absolutely optimal.

It's also worth noting what has already been mentioned, that just because most people train a different way, doesn't make what the masses do the best way. Going back to cycling, look at how British cycling or team sky looked at things totally differently after people had relatively training their aerobic systems the same way, for almost a hundred years. They then reinvented the wheel and everyone had to catch up. Obviously there were outliers who understood threshold training, use of power meters before, but they brought it to the masses. In my opinion we could be in the midst of something similar for running, due to the success of the Norwegians. This isn't a miracle. It's not suddenly turned me world class. But I do think it's the best way to eek out the maximum of my relatively limited talent. If you think, it's still not that different to a more classic approach. Before I was running 1 easy, 3 moderate runs, a vo2 max session and some sort of tempo along with the \"long\" run. Now I'm running 3 easy runs, 3 threshold and 1 long run. The key difference is the latter is slowly creating more stress, week after week on the body so you get fitter and fitter whilst feeling sustainable. It's just more work.

But it you did 2 marathon paced workouts for example, that's still more TSS scored than one of these sessions I outlined. But I think I've heard people successfully targeting 1.5-2 in the morning mmol and maybe 3 mmol in the evening. Im more up around the 3.5 range in the single session. But if I was to double, I would probably do MP in the morning and then instead of say 12-15 k effort in the evening, make sure I was no faster than 15k in the evening. I hope that makes sense. You are basically doing the same paces I am now and for me it doesn't feel easy, but it also doesn't feel hard. The last one in the 10x1k I sometimes feel a bit. But I've dialled these all into paces that match up with my actual lactate responses when I've tested. So it may be slightly different for you. What I posted is just a guide. The one thing I would say, is if you are worried you are going to hard, dial it back a bit. It's most important not to go over. That's where even a few minutes a bit over threshold, you can really feel it the next day. Even at 90% of LT, studies have reported you are still getting 97% of the benefit. So I just don't see any reason to really push it and blow yourself up long term. I think if you can run what you are doing, run easy the next day + then go again the day after - keep doing what you are doing. It took me more than a month for a breakthrough, for what is worth.

If you look at what the oldest hobby jogger does, who does singles - I believe he does all the paces also around what I have posted. The younger brothers, who all do way more miles and doubled, I believe ease of the pace a little more. I think for singles, you push it mostly to as close to threshold as you can safely, without risking going over. I'm going to go back to where I started with this - and talk about CTL. These aren't necessarily 'real' numbers, just using them as a guide as an example. For instance, if you were doubling you might run the 1ks in the evening and 5x6 in the morning. The 5x6 might give you a TSS of 65-70 at marathon pace and the 1ks at 95% CV around the same again. Whereas on singles, myself/ the older brother are running the 1ks around 12-15k pace (faster than 95% CV, and 95% is around HM pace for me) and for me this might create a TSS of 85. All these runs keep you below threshold , but the doubles are much safer, in that range where you might be getting 97% of the benefit for 90% of the effort. But over time, TSS and CTL wins. You'll obviously create a HUGE amount more doubling, even though you are running slightly easier. I believe, the singles brother and myself - have both decided or accidentally stumbled on the same idea that you want to be able to get every other day, but also want the most TSS. The doubles. I've ran slower but maybe created 140 tss a day rather than 80-85. What I'm also not doing and neither is the older brother, is the \"X\" factor session either. Or the hills. Or 10x300 I've heard Jacob do or anything like that. As I've tried to outline, I'm not trying to copy the professional Norwegian's. Just adapt it, to something manageable and sustainable any hobby jogger could do, if they have the discipline. I think others have point out as well as myself, the issue is most people will run this too fast. Once you do that a few times in a week, it's all over. The next session becomes too hard, or the recovery run isn't enough, then you suddenly find yourself in a hole halfway through the next session. One thing I've learned from cycling is going on feel is the most outdated concept. You won't see anyone racing or training on feel anymore be hugely successful. The power meter numbers, the training zones, it's all made people better riders based on the science.

I wish I had stuck to my guns initially, as my gut reaction to running was TSS was TSS, which creates CTL (to use the terms I'm familiar with from training peaks) which is what creates fitness. For the individual, you can create a training score and to within maybe 98% your fitness will be the same. As an extreme, I could probably achieve similar with running twice as much a week, but all easy pace with maybe one tempo run. But that would take double the amount of hours. But in terms of training load/CTL, would be the same. Id probably still be the same in a 5k. This is why you hear stories of guys running insane hours a week, mostly all easy (training for an ultra maybe) but then setting PBS all over the place in shorter distances. You can't compare other people's training loads, it's all individualised, as training score/CTL is just a number. But from what I know about myself in two sports + a lot of friends I have spoken to, that individuals score of say \"60\" (this is a random number) equates to roughly the same times for say a 5k-10k for that person.

I deliberately went over when I was in testing phase and had the lactate meter, on the last rep.

The planned off day is actually a lot more liberating psychologically than you'd think. Plus, it makes it so the other days you do structure can actually be more consistent since you aren't constantly pushing something a bit too taxing the day before you want to push the quality session. I'd say it's almost a sliding scale when the week starts based on recovery index. The week is generally planned to be: LT2, Z2, Easy, LT2, Z2, Easy/Z2 but if recovered and feeing good can be: LT2, Z2, LT2, Easy, LT2, Easy or if not recovering well: LT2, Z2, Easy, Z2, Easy, Z2 This is where i think the experience with yourself and a wearable is helpful. Whether it's using a wearable, using a lactate meter, whatever, you are just trying to manage and monitor stress appropriately. Same thing inside the sessions.

Now regarding the statement I quoted above, I beg to differ: I have been dabbling with a lactate meter (Lactate Plus) for the past few months. In my personal experience, you definitely do much less than 20x400 w/30\" @ 10K pace and be well over 4.0 mmol/L. Context: I have run a 37:45 10K last April which is 3:46/km pace or 1:30.4 per 400m. I've been upping my mileage since that, now running my third week of 100 km (62 miles). I've been doing mostly one LT session to not over-stress my self too much since I was not used to this mileage. I have bumped it up to two sessions by last week. I introduced a 10x400m w/30\" rest last week as a second LT session. Given that the rest is very short, I only managed to take two lactate readings (After 4th and 10th reps). Here are my splits for the 400's: 1) 01:34.1 2) 01:29.4 3) 01:33.8 4) 01:29.1 = 4.8 mmol/L 5) 01:33.7 6) 01:31.7 7) 01:34.7 8) 01:30.8 9) 01:34.3 10) 01:32.1 = 4.9 mmol/L As you can see, all except one rep were slower than 10K pace, yet I was well above 4.0 mmol/L. Where is the catch? I have run my 10K race in a temperate climate, where-as my current training is taking place in brutally humid and hot conditions. This goes to say that lactate is dynamic and context dependent. A blanket, absolute statement such as the one quoted above is misleading. Now when I run similar pace on the treadmill it is a different story, even for 10 minute reps, I'm under 3 mmol/L for most of my reps, albeit them being a bit slower.

Not sure where youre taking the sample from, Lactate Plus needs a bigger volume of blood which many times gives the opportunity for more sweat contamination in the sample itself. Obviously the ear lobe is almost out of the question when doing it yourself, but if youre not really cleansing the site with at least some wet paper towel and then drying, you are going to get higher than normal readings if sweat is getting in the sample. It's always harder outside with unstable environmental variables. Also, that 10k time is from April. Not sure what your training has been on the top end since then.

You are going to need to take a little longer break to get the test done adequately. If you were trying to do the 20, you are really doing a 2x10x400 workout with 1:00R/2:00R between sets for the lactate test. :60 seconds for a test can even be rushing it sometimes, especially if you are drenched. You can see at least the deviation is consistent. Sweat could produce a 1.0 mmol deviation here, seen it many times when the site isnt clean or you wind up touching your finger and not letting the tip just hit the blood sample itself, so its very possible you could be at around 4.0 at least for your workouts. With the Lactate Plus you might want to try taking the sample with your finger above the strip rather than the meter above your finger. Ive noticed that helping the results with that meter.

You should absolutely not be doing 3 sessions, nor double thresholds. This is not a magic formula. I'm not sure why everyone forgot that every runner is different as soon as Jakob came around and started trying to copy his training. Also, modifying his training to 30 miles a week defeats the whole purpose. He trains with a lot of threshold volume and mileage and that's the whole point of his training. I understand you are just trying to get better and I respect that, but I would definitely consider a different plan. His plan only works with high mileage to be honest.",

I am not aware of a study showing that doing 95% LT pace, creates 97% of the training effect. But the point is, that speed/power and duration are interconnected. If you can hold 300W for 60minutes, you can hold 290W for a longer time. So if we improve the duration we can hold at 290W, we the time we can hold 300W and that shifts LT up. We can then hold 300W for longer time as 60minutes. Sirpoc84, you said you have 3E, 3Q and 1L running sessions/week. What is your training distribution between (3E+L) and 3Q?

He's also shifted to saying easy is around 70% of max HR after the recent study in 2022, the training characteristics of long distance runners, or something like that it was called. It was very good and covered a lot of the top guys. The board agreement, was the \"easy\" was classed as 70% anyway. It doesn't surprise me he's maybe gone to a 2 zone model. Simply because he was living in Norway and the Norwegians have made him look a little silly as he always said don't do any sub threshold stuff lol ðŸ˜‚ so I'm guessing he's just pushed that into the hard category. But then it all becomes a bit too simplistic. It's almost best for him probably to suggest something like 1mmol and under for the easy and 2mmol and above, or something like that, for the polarisation. It's hard to keep up with him as he is on every podcast and doing talks all the time he does contractict himself a bit, I find.

    "msg": "Yes, you are talking about pushing up your threshold from below. I'm mentioned this a few times I probably sound like a broken record, but this is something cyclists have known for a while now and with the advent of power meters it makes it insanely easy to train in that area, not go too hard and recover. Someone mentioned cross country skiers, applies to them as well and I've heard of speed skaters as well who have trained like this for a while. If you are a time crunched cyclist, if you aren't doing quite a bit of this training on your turbo trainer, you are behind the training curve. Good question about training distribution. Again, as I posted above Seiler orginally (20 years ago) said 80/20 was split into sessions. As I said before, you can never tell exactly where he stands but he's started to come around to the idea that for hobby joggers and cyclists, time in zone he would accept. Mainly because we aren't running doubles, so it's not realistic to have as much easy. I've looked at studies more recent, they usually include \"time in zone\" , although that is almost complicated in the sense it could be power on the bike, pace for runners or HR as the metric. Anyway, for me, on the bike I always just went on power. It's the easiest of all the metrics to collect meaningful data on. I was usually around always between 70/80 - 20/30 on the bike. This would be the same pretty much, no matter how many hours I did. For running, I've been going on pace. I live in a very flat area. So I can go on loops for 15k with like 10 meters of elevation on a road run. Again, if we are going in time on some, just having a look now, the last 6 weeks average out to 74/26. With the schedule I outlined above . This is polarised in the fact there is nothing aimed in the 3:58-4:57/km range other than what you might catch for a few seconds changing paces or whatever. But again, Seiler originally intended for sessions not zones (but has conceded a point as I mentioned) and a lot of the \"longer\" 2-3k reps are going to be also in the zones he would probably tell you not to run. But I like the idea of trying to fit 75/25 or 80/20 or roughly whatever you want, into just under LT1 and then in that just under LT2 threshold for the harder stuff, to push that up from below. This is a pure rough estimate that won't apply to everyone, but for me that's about anything 90-91% of LTHR up to 98% LTHR. So you have quite a wide margin of error. But if I'm somewhere in there, I'm seeing lactate numbers that are going to be giving me good stimulus for my \"20\" work , without wrecking me.",

I do sometimes think about baseball when I think about stuff like this. Not saying it's made baseball better to actually watch it's robotic now, but how sabermetrics have helped improve players or scouting of players. The old scouts saying how this is how it's always been done, you think in 100 years we couldn't have worked out a better way? Discipline has been mentioned . I think you would have to change the mentality of groups of coached runners over time, because no doubt people will ruin these workouts quite quickly and go to hard.

You aren't going to die or your legs fall off and or you'll never be a be able to run again if you go into super threshold, or beyond ðŸ˜‚ But you will start to cross that border where fatigue seems to accumulate fast, real fast, and then suddenly it's not easy to do an easy 10k the next day and then go again the following day with another session. I mentioned before, I had a friend do this. His claim was he was \"feeling great\" and pushed way past 12-15k that we had worked out for him should create the lactate response we wanted. He did this a few times back to back and then suddenly the week after , he's trashed. The whole principle is living on the edge, not falling off the edge of choosing to jump off the edge. Maximising training load, whilst maintaining something that can be recovered from, relatively quickly. It's why I really wish there was a good power solution for running. With cycling is very easy to just say I don't care how good you feel. This is the power zones for the workout, stick to it. It's why I posted the paces up that I work to, as for where I live and it being flat it's probably the best I've got without having to buy lactate strips week after week as they're expensive (although if I was a pro I obviously would).",

    "msg": "This is a great thread indeed! I came to using a threshold focused structure through lots of experiment and, seemingly, sub-par race results when I would include intervals faster than about 10km pace. It was in 2017 when I started to use the following structure: Sun - AM: 60 min PM: 30 min Mon - AM: 60 min PM: 30 min Tue - Tempo Intervals (12*1K w/ 200m, 6*2K w/ 400m, 4*3K w/ 600m) Wed - 90 min Thu - Tempo Intervals (12*1K w/ 200m, 6*2K w/ 400m, 4*3K w/ 600m) Fri - 90 min Sat - 120-150 min (including 8-10 miles of tempo intervals) For a period leading up to a half marathon and marathon, I would include tempo intervals in the Saturday long run as well. Typically in the form of 15 min + 6*1600m (or 3*3200m) + 60 min + 4*1600m + 15 min. I basically pulled this from Daniels' T-L-T workouts. After the marathon I was focusing on a 10km race so began doing the long run easy and did the Tuesday tempo intervals on Monday. As has been mentioned already, I found the key to sustaining this was to keep the sessions controlled. I seemed to fall into a pace that was 0-5 seconds per km slower than my half marathon pace, so not true LT. This I think is key as if I tried to run my LT pace, I'd feel like I was reaching and would have not been able to sustain this structure. With the exception of the long run session, I'd finish the workouts feeling like I could have done more and gone faster. The few times I broke this weekly structure was the Tuesday workout, ten days before a Saturday (or Sunday) race. For the half marathon I did 4*4K w/ 400m, for the 10k I did a 10km time trial, and for the marathon I did a 18 mile tempo at marathon pace (I did this on the long run two weeks before the race). The result, for me, was a PR in all three races, which were spaced six weeks apart. The strength that you develop and ability to recover between workouts and from races was most notable to me! Also, I should add because I think it is important, my easy days were all very easy (i.e. no faster than 70% max HR, often under 65%).
