    "msg": "@obturator. I'm with you. I couldn't do 5 x 2K @ HM pace and be fresh two days later. Maybe because I'm at the wrong side of 40. For my legs a total of 10k @ HM pace would be a recipe for injury if I did something like that 3 times a week. Since the idea is to do workouts that DON'T feel too hard, I would suggest you do 5 x 2 @ MP or even slower. After all, the pace we run in a marathon is after a taper, fully carb-loaded and with new super shoes. That same pace feels a lot harder untapered in regular running shoes and after a hard day's work ! I once asked sirpoc this question, and he thought there is a range of paces sub threshold that give the desired training effect, with MP probably at the lower end but still good.",

I do these workouts on Tue &/or Thur after work when I'm already tired walking out of the building. Then it's dark, windy, & cold which doesn't help things (more excuses). I'm going tweak my schedule around & try doing a workout on a weekend & I bet it'll be a lot easier. I think I'm going to forget about trying to squeeze 3 workouts in a week until winter is over &/or work calms down. Had someone quit at work again so I'm working extra with lots of walking & time on my feet. May see if I can rearrange my schedule to start work a little later & do workout before work instead when legs are fresh. @Xlzyt Race was done in an older pair of Brooks Hyperions. Workouts are usually done in a trainer (Ghost, Novablast, or Nimbus). I have done a couple 1k repeats in the Hyperion & those workouts did seem easier. Good point about the shoes. Hills make it tough & you're right I should adjust pace accordingly. I try to look at total net +/- elevation for a rep to find stretches that are fairly even. @Charlesvdw Ya, I'm at the wrong side of 40 too. Closer to 50 than I am 40. I like your idea of using MP for the 2k workouts instead of HM pace, so workouts don't feel too hard.

You should finish feeling like you did a workout, but not like you went all out. Keep that feeling in mind and slow things down or reduce the volume. Your rest intervals are shorter than they have to be. 2 minutes rest is specified for 3K reps, so I let the rest interval range from 1-2 minutes depending on rep length. One of the ways I've progressed these workouts is by shortening the rests as I get fitter. At the beginning I needed extra rest. Instead of trying to hit particular paces from the start, I look at pace as a function of recovery: What pace can I sustain for 1 mile (for example) and be ready for another rep after 1 minute of rest? How many mile reps can I do before going over the edge from moderate to hard? And most importantly: What pace and volume can I do and still recover by the time the next workout comes along?",

And I‘m fairly sure I’ve been pushing the pace a bit too much on a couple of them… Do you have another longer race to compare to or calculate from? You’re taking the fastest listed paces for your 18:39 — your 1km reps could be more like 6:39 pace and be in the pace span, but keep in mind that the 5km is still under 20 minutes. It’s a highly aerobic race, but short enough that your ability to burn energy above threshold before fatigue (W' in cyclist jargon), which varies significantly between athletes, still plays a significant role. You also say you’re more of a fast twitch athlete. These pace bounds probably work for most people, but some people will be outliers too. I‘d say set a *fastest* pace of 6:40/mile for the 1km repeats for you. Start more like 7min/mile pace and work your way down to 6:40 pace by the end. See how that feels. Once you’ve gotten used to training around and below your threshold, you can do a lot based on feel. Not sure just how hilly the area you’re training in is, but the variation between my intervals based on hills is significant, i.e. over a min/mile pace difference. I cannot use pace in those circumstances whatsoever. In your case, I would also switch to using time and other metrics (power, GAP, HR) or just running on feel. Basically, you should scale these workouts such that doing three per week is doable — that’s largely the point of the system! And I‘d like to hammer home the point above about slowing your easy pace. If you’re doing a more traditional base phase, running high Z2 might make sense sometimes. Here, it’s best just to really go easy. Try to make your routes interesting so you aren’t bored!",

Look at the basic philosophy in a nutshell: The goal of SubT is to improve aerobic fitness by maximizing training load per week, which for time-constrained amateurs targeting 5K-HM races is best accomplished with 3 SubT workouts, a moderate long run, and some very easy runs. Compare that with EIM: The goal is to develop a reactive stride by doing only workouts that include faster-pace intervals in some form. Easy running is harmful to this process and should be avoided. EIM will work for all athletes, from novice to pro, training for 800m-marathon. If you can't do EIM workouts every day, it's better to cross train. So yeah, some of the workouts are vaguely similar, but the two approaches are attempting to accomplish entirely different things in completely different ways. And it shows in how SubT thinks easy runs are great, while EIM thinks they're bad. There are only moderate-effort days in EIM but no easy days, while in SubT there are only moderate-effort weeks.

Just because coaching has been done a certain way , certainly since Daniel's has popularised mass market coaching, doesn't mean it's the best way.

Have typically followed Pfitzinger training plans for the last few years (rotating 5/10/15 km type training plans). To be fair they have worked OK for me, have seen steady improvement. Was targeting a 10 mile race, so thought I would trial this type of training. Also fulfils the specificity argument as I run 10 miles in under an hour, so good threshold kind of pace - hence plenty of work around threshold can’t be a bad thing. Simply rotated 5x 6 mins, 8x 1 km and 20x 400m workouts every third day for the last few months. Having said that, depending how I’m feeling I still like longer progression runs and tempo runs so still getting a balanced diet so to speak. I found the workouts manageable, obviously easier than some of the Pfitzinger VO2max workouts which can leave me a bit dead. Always tried to keep my HR not getting much higher than 85-87% of max. Took 2 mins off my 10 mile time. Whether that can be wholly attributed to this style of training, not sure (I’ve had a very nice steady 6 months of 100 km/week which can’t be a bad thing), but I found it OK and easy to follow - and felt less beat up than Pfitzinger. I’m generally sceptical that any training plan is massively efficacious compared to any other, but I certainly didn’t regress using this approach. I did a 5 km TT a month or so ago and my pace had improved slightly, so still some gains even though I wasn’t doing anything specific at that kind of pace for quite a while. I do have my own prejudice that you can gain some psychological strength from really hard workouts, which this style of training doesn’t really get you to. That might just be my own mental myth.

The big things on injury prevention are sleep, nutrition, stress management, and proper training load. If you have a specific issue get a custom plan from a PT or otherwise educate yourself on how to address that specific issue. Of all the studies I looked at that say strength training improves running economy, performance, whatever... I haven't really seen a strong body of evidence that reallocating running time for lifting time makes already fit people better. Like most exercise phys research in general the majority of studies tended to be some version of \"we made some average people actually train hard and it made them slightly less average\". The research that was with high-level athletes tends to be adding it to an existing program, but also doesn't explore just making them run more.

    "msg": "To add, I found the Steve Magness videos on sprint training for endurance runners and on tension to be helpful. I'd recommend watching them from start to finish since key points are spread throughout. But one thing I'd emphasize is how strength training and sprinting are much easier to maintain than to build. So it may be a little disruptive to the training recommended by this thread, but that's only when you're building. Maintaining it is so much easier than building, such that it is almost certainly time-efficient once you're in maintenace mode. The same can be said for people who are perpetually tight: stretching is a big time commitment to make progress but maintaining it is very easy once you've reached a comfortable level. And the last similar thing that comes to mind is body composition. Spend time working on it once to get it in a good spot and then maintaining it is easy and will benefit you for years. The relevance of the tension video here is that the ways to increase tension could be quite tiring if you never do any strength or sprint training. But if you have developed your strength and speed, then you can do effective strength and speed work without incurring significant fatigue. Also, these subthreshold workouts and slow easy runs will only lower tension. Some runners could find that the training makes them feel flat, making the tension methods even more important and yet harder to do simultaneously, as they'll be a new stimulus that's extra fatiguing. Not a good spot to be in, but easy to fix. Maybe I'm getting the wrong impression but it's disappointing that people seem to be a bit close-minded about including other things and defensive about the training method here. I don't think strength and sprint work are threatening to the method. Just a tiny bit of periodization or a one-time \"special block\" to develop them and then reduce them 75% to maintenance mode are some really promising optimizations / tweaks imo. Practically speaking, I'd at least wager that combining plyos/strength/sprinting all into one exercise: 6-8s hill sprints, is worth the time. On the other hand, I'd wager that doing heavy compound lifts, as John Whelan suggests, is inefficient -- very fatiguing for not a lot of relevance to endurance running. In fact the elites who do lift heavy are nowadays reducing the range of motion of lifts to make them more targeted and running-specific and less fatiguing.",

In most cases thats probably a good thing -we may not want the extra shock overload, but I still don't want to be dismissive of non-running plyometrics altogether! With lifting you lose a lot specificity and time, and may add some soreness but you can still get some benefits while eliminating impact altogether. I've found you keep the volume really low 3-4x <5 reps and consistently do it 2-3x the week the fatigue is not terrible, so it's just a matter of time commitment.

Until I found this thread. What sirpoc laid out, made sense in theory, after all it wasn't just what to do, but why. Many thanks to him by the way, whatever anyone things the dude has given more to hobby joggers in my opinion, than 99% of these influencers with thousands of disciples. I found this thread in February 2024, so my journey is coming close to a year. I am a mediocre runner. My biggest achievement was winning my local parkrun, if that is even a thing. I ran 19:23 and I am 35 years old. I got there through a lot of hard work. A mixture of classic stuff like Daniel's 2Q plans and specific strength sessions, got me to around 19:05. I certainly felt stronger with some lifting etc. This was all around 2023. Back to February 2024 and like I mentioned, something just struck me with all the knowledge here. I've seen other posts saying the same, so I think there's something about the lay out etc and sirpoc's explanations that resonates with people, the 'Ah that is me' when he describes the struggles. I started off with good fitness it must be said, with 5 years in the bank and a near 19 flat. Not good but obviously not terrible. So I basically jumped straight in. The paces were very near what I could cope with, although I was a little thrown off with how easy the easy runs were and that took a lot of time to adjust to compared to other programs. The main issue I noticed after a few weeks, was how hard it was to do some basic lifting and stregth work and fit in 3 sub threshold workouts. In fact, it was near on impossible. My legs hurt couldn't cope with the demands. The strength stuff was merely standard stuff you will see in a lot of classic coaching books and manuals. I jumped on the side of the fence that I would just throw the lifting and stregth work out of the window and purely went 4x easy and 3 x sub threshold and nothing else, not even strides. Oh boy did I make the right choice. By Christmas parkrun, I ran 17:22. The progress was pretty steady. I had a breakthrough around week 7 in training which translated to a PB in week 9. It's been pretty steady since. I was have dropped maybe 10 seconds on average each parkrun. Yes, I am racing maybe once maybe 3-4 weeks. But I was doing that for the previous 5 years so it's not like suddenly that's the big factor. Another big note here, is initially I was doing 6 hours a week for most of that time, while I was doing 6 hours a week for most of this, I have slowly been able to ramp it up to 7. This is the first time in my running life I have got anywhere near 7 on a week by week basis and I feel a ton better than I did on my previous 6. Here is the interesting bit. I added strides back in and some lifting around the new year. Suddenly, I really started to struggle. After the first week or so, I assumed it would just take time to get back into it, but if anything it got worse. My legs just felt like lead when it came to sub threshold days. Anyway, the last week or so I have given back up strides and anything you could consider strength work and almost straight away within a few days it suddenly felt like 4x easy and 3x sub threshold was definitely doable again. I'm not sure if there's a conclusion here, but I just thought I would post based on the fact it seems to be a big debate of what to include on top. My legs probably actually felt stronger and less fatigued in general with the long period of nothing but running. I actually only got back into it because of a couple of videos I saw from some old school coaches and it convinced me now with the biggest base I have ever had, to add that work back in. Anyway guys, thanks for the amazing thread, all the big contributions, the Strava group and thanks to sirpoc for his original posts. Whatever motivated him to do so, I'm glad you did! Keeping an eye out for if he ever does a marathon?! I believe the London Championship entry list went out today. Is he on it?

    "msg": "I'd expect it to be a struggle to integrate it and for other training to suffer temporarily. Whether the other training suffers permanently is the unknown. I think some amount must be possible but what's the correct amount to achieve some benefit without compromising your important sessions? But my philosophy is why bother until you've plateaued? You can keep building volume until you're using all your allotted time for training. Then you can keep increasing paces until they plateau. Only then are you really forced to find out where the bottleneck is and if it's something you can improve. If it ever does come to that, I think you could at least maintain aerobic fitness while you work on speed, and then at some point speed/strength becomes less fatiguing (it's not a new stimulus anymore) and you also do it less (because you're just maintaining now, not building) and so you can reinstate your normal training. Or you could take another approach and introduce the smallest amounts of speed/strength possible such that they couldn't possibly have a significant effect. 1 stride that turns into 2 strides, strides slowly turn to 90% sprinting, and those turn into a single hill sprint, which turns into 2 hill sprints, etc. I think there's some individual physiology at play here too, whether genetic or from training history. Some people will have an easier time building strength and speed standards while others will have an easier time hitting higher volumes of slower running. I personally have a lot easier time sprinting than most distance runners and a lot harder time building volume. So I'm aware it might not be the best general advice to tell people to do hill sprints like it's so easy. Just focusing on fatigue to benefit ratio, if a certain kind of training is more or less fatiguing for an individual, then they should take advantage of it or avoid it. You see the most variety in 800m runners. I don't think the low mileage speedster 800 runners should try to build to 80mpw as a long term goal to reach their full potential. And the 80mpw guys should not drop mileage to try to hit the same 400m time as the speedsters. But I still think that, ultimately, if we're talking about the most time-efficient training or if we're talking about time-unlimited training, then strides/strength/plyos/sprinting make it in there in some form. I think current consensus is strides and hill sprints are the most effective and you can integrate strides into easy runs so there's no time lost or mileage sacrificed. I think no one recommends doing jog recoveries for true hill sprints (I always hear walk back and standing recovery) but I'd imagine that jogging the recoveries is not that bad. Or you sacrifice some time/mileage for the sake of standing recoveries.",

The huge success of this method for hobby joggers, means this method here, Reddit and Strava has blown up. The big problem seems to be however, people don't understand it . Like, for real. I've seen people quoting sirpoc on stuff the dude ever ever said. Or now there's guys telling 18-20 min 5k runners what they lack is speed. The fact that anyone can even say that shows 1. They haven't used the method themselves or 2. They don't get it. Quite quickly you are just sliding into a Daniel's 2Q plans or the like if you think like that. I initially thought this idea was difficult to get wrong. But actually, the inherent greed of runners for pushing themselves in training, or the inherent need to look good on Strava workouts etc. is where people are messing up. The basics are the basics, but the complicated stuff is understanding what load is and how it can be quantified in a repeated manner. It was relatively new to me, but I'm glad I took the time to understand what is going on under the hood here. Without calling anyone out, as I've been in the Strava group , I think there were a couple of guys who maybe didn't go all in on this method, but now have and I'm always looking out for their progress and it's really good to see. But, I think it takes everyone a while to really fully understand what they are doing. With that, it comes back to who to listen to. The usual suspects from this group I believe are admins of the group? All of who, are the ones I look out for on Strava posts. Sirpoc chirps in plenty and it's always worth listening to what he says along with the others. I think really it would be great to pin sirpoc down to what he still believes, what holds true from the thread originally etc as I think for someone coming in now, there's a lot of hot air and nonsense that has nothing to do with the method or people are adding stuff in that will distort results, or coming full circle to the point I'm replying to, totally forgetting there's a different between a hobby jogger running 2 hours HM or sirpoc running 1:09.",

The thing is, he's not even saying you MUST train like this, but pointing out there's a specific way for the most part of you want to be able to do this long term. You have guys basically totally not understanding whatsoever what even paces they should be running. It's kinda wild. If I was him I would take a podcast invite or write a book himself or something, it's grown so much there probably needs a definitive recap, as I agree there is a wild amount and ton of misinformation. Maybe less on here but Strava, Reddit and other social media is a mess with this NSM buzzword but not even reading the orgins of this thread! There's even a decent amount of folk who still think 18- 22 min runners are lacking speed for the 5k and that's what they are lacking. Which is again pretty wild if you look at how for all the testimonials we have had here + sirpoc ridiculously good progress at 40+ years old, obviously isn't the case. I don't think people are grasping aerobic gains outweigh pretty much anything else, until you get to a certain point. Which the majority of us will never get to.",

I think those of us who have followed, copied and trained with success using a lot of the stuff from early on where the thread was smaller, Strava group smaller etc......well we really had it good because there was less nonsense to get through. On the other hand, I feel guilty for even saying this, as there's an insane amount of free resources on Strava, from sirpoc84, Hard2find and others that 100% by rights should be behind a paywall and likely 99% of others would have done so by now.

Yet systematically building a base that just continues to grow, we have seen time and time again in this thread especially, will probably allow you in the long run to take literal minutes off your PB.

    "msg": "Marathoner here. I'm trying to transition my training to Norwegian singles and I'm wondering if I should do two or three sessions a week. Also wondering about combining a session with the long run. I've just come off some training that was almost the opposite of this training -- I was doing a hard session only once every 1-2 weeks. Everything else was easy jogging except some strides and hill sprints (these were also infrequent). I think this was the right thing for me at the time in order to build the strength I needed to survive the marathon at the pace that I already had the aerobic capacity to do. But I've got a long time (over 8 months) until my next race so I think it's right to train differently for a while. The point is I'm used to very infrequent workouts so this is a big change. I'd think 3 sessions is actually easier assuming you aren't overdoing them. But it could go bad really quickly if you are overdoing them. So I'm thinking 3 sessions and very conservative on the paces for 3-4 weeks until I feel really confident I'm not overtraining (also keeping any other training like strength/speed very light until I get this established). And I like the idea of doing 10min intervals at 30k/MP and having that be part of the long run (having a longer warmup and cooldown than the other sessions). Is that sensible or is there a strong recommendation to have a long run that's pure easy mileage and keep the sessions separate? Is that supposed to be easier?",
