(We've already gone over them; it's just a matter of going back through the pages lol).

    "msg": "This continues to be an interesting and thought provoking thread. I’ve enjoyed the serious discussion as well as the scattered troll insults. Some pretty clever ones a few pages back. Some additional thoughts: - We should keep in mind that “low volume” is basically the antithesis of the “Norwegian training philosophy”. Their goal is to train as much as possible. This applies to Jakob, the triathletes, and even Karsten Warholm. As Sirpoc writes though, this 3x per week threshold method does allow for about as much training as an adult with a family/job can handle. - On that note, if the goal is to improve, your goal should be to always be doing more. It is about what you can consistently sustain, so the progression will be extremely slow. One way to think about it: over a few months it might look like you aren’t progressing or changing the training at all, but look a year later and you should see a difference. - In running, as you hit high speeds the load on the muscles/tendons is exponentially higher. I recently tried to add a hill day as my 3rd workout and a few weeks later ended up with an achilles injury. I think that as you get older, the impact of high intensity workouts on recovery is greater. And I think Jakob thinks the same thing — this is why he says it is harder to be good at 1500 compared to 5k at older age. - For those commenting that you can’t race a good 5k without ever running fast in training: first, note that Sirpoc is running a lot of 5k races. My personal experience is that it can be a little hard to push myself after a few months of this training (only did it once). Recently, I did a 5k and in the lead up did a workout where I’d do 5 x 1k, starting at the usual mile repeat threshold pace with 1 minute rest, and after the first 2 reps, increased the pace to the 3k-5k pace range, extending the rest before 3rd/4th/5th rep. I felt that it helped me to work into the pace (being not used to it), but also prepare to hit the slightly higher lactate levels. I’ll probably use that again in the future (when the achilles is better). Some observations from KI strava: - It is remarkable how much volume a person can progress to doing on this system. KI is doing 36-42k of work per week at this reasonably high intensity. That is massive. Note how he is constantly doing more. Anyone who says Jakob is just doing 2x 10k threshold sessions on Tues/Thurs is forgetting that the main principle is to always do more. There is no way he is doing the same volume as he did a few years ago. (Nordas implied this in an interview as well) - The focus seems to be on the pace, much more than the exact lactate. It seems like he checks lactate at the end to calibrate where he is, and also to decide what to do next session. But the pace is very tightly controlled (he even uses wave light, which is remarkable in my mind). - He ran a 10k at 3:20 pace back when he never went below 3:30 on any intervals. Race pace may be over rated. - When he was first making his massive improvements, his interval pace was actually slower than the HM paces he eventually would hit. This was even for 1k-2k reps. And back then he typically would just run the same pace for 1k, 2k, 3k reps. Now he seems to adjust more, but I thought that was interesting. - They pay attention to everything to ensure progress. I believe he previously was running easy days a bit faster (7:20/mile or like 4:35/k), but now is more often closer to 8:00/mile or 5min/k pace. He tried a period of slightly lower volume of shorter, faster reps (10x1k) but felt banged up and didn’t improve much, so reverted to 12+k of longer reps. Initially long runs were shorter but in the last several months has started doing ~2 hours or 26k long runs. - While the training started at about 1 hour per day, he’s doing quite a bit more than that now. So us (likely less talented) regular hobby joggers should not expect indefinite improvements if we aren’t also gradually progressing the training volume. - People reference Tinman a lot on this thread. He did seem to have some understanding of this, but I’ve recently been thinking how it is crazy that a hobby jogger like KI can be training at what seems like significantly higher training stress than a Tinman athlete like Drew Hunter. I know Drew is no longer with Tinman, but workouts like 8 x 1k + some 200s seem somewhat unimpressive when KI is doing 14 x 1k on a Saturday. Makes you wonder if Drew was coached by Gjert how much better he would have been. Well that was quite the novel. I guess I’ve been thinking about this a lot.",

The goal is basically to cram as much as we can in without breaking down. This sub threshold range with the rest seems to be the sweetspot, if you want to call it that. I do about 105 minutes a week out of my 7 hours I've allocated for training as of right now. You get fitter , simply because this seems to be the highest range of lactate you can reach pretty much every other day without fatigue setting in. I'm on about a year straight of this with a tiny break got COVID in between and running every day. I know some people like the idea of a day off. But I feel worse when I do so just have got used to running everyday. I think this is highly individual. Listen to your body. If you really know you can't run everyday, don't. It's also convenient for me, I can pretty much so the same stuff, on the same days per week to fit it into my lifestyle. I've also noticed as pointed out above , KI has really ramped it up. He's still on singles and the same system basically, just pushing the envelope. The really long runs and stuff like 14x1k maybe suggests he's training for a marathon?

Instead of trying to start by running at or just below your LT from the get-go, start even further below that until you're acclimated, then progress gradually toward that LT line.

Both are indeed non-linear (exponential and logarithmic, approximately, respectively). I’ve referenced this before, but Daniels has a point system in his second edition. Same as Tinman, if you plot the training stress as %VO2Max, you see an exponential relationship. Daniels has a lot of really insightful information beyond E, M, T, I, and R pace. I was thinking to create a document with all the “technical” aspects (equations, charts, tables, analytical methods examples) of what we have been talking about, but wasn’t sure if that would be of interest? Similarly, since TSS and CTL seem to be popular amongst the group. I did create an equivalent plot/equation as the one Tinman and Daniels have, to compare. Again, it plots the training stress (points per minute) as a function of the Intensity Factor you are running at. I found that while the TSS is not linear, it doesn’t have quite an exponential form either.

I would turn that into an easy long. Add in another easy for 6 days if you can , then you probably wont be far off and you can slowly up it. I started off with less hours/ mileage and 10x3 was my shorter session, that has now become 10x1k for about an extra 5-6 minutes. I made that bigger by increasing my overall hours a week, then with the 25% in mind proportionally adding on 5 mins of sun threshold time when I've added on 15 mins more easy time across the week. Exactly the same , 5x6 became 5x2k, again for around an extra 5-6 mins. In the end, like any system, you'll need to do something to get fitter. But I feel with this you can just slowly up it. Again, KI Strava is great if you have time. Have a look back right to the start and how he's really slowly added on just a few minutes here and there weekly , slowly. This is where (I'm sure everyone is bored of this) CTL is great. As again, if you keep all your zone metrics updated, you can see when your CTL is stopping to increase - or at least flattening off, and then you can look at where or how you can up it ever so slightly. This is where my experience at training like this helps, I'm confident in following that - knowing it will work over years and years outside of running. There will be a point I literally don't have time to increase load anymore, I'm probably close to being there, which is where the PBs will stop and I'll have to have a rethink.",

You need to build your base and get mileage up a bit, then you can make use of their method. Here's a good way to do it: On Tuesday, do a single thresh session. Making this a continuous session like a fartlek is wise. Thursday, run a tempo or progression run. It'll be a tick easier than thresh but still a good quality day. Saturday, do another thresh session, perhaps some track reps this time. After some time maintaining this model, you can increase mileage by introducing doubles on your easy days. Doing a 6-7 mile run in the morning and a 5-6 mile run in the evening is a great approach. At some point (when you feel ready for it) you can switch the Thursday progression run/tempo a progression long run. Once you're sustaining 65 miles per week or so on this model, you can start throwing in a second threshold session on Tuesday, and if you want, an easy long run on Sunday. That training model will come in at 65-75 miles per week.

I'm not sure if this means anything, but my last 5k was a TSS of 35-37 range, depending on if you go by pace, power or hrTSS. TRIMP was 60. My last 10x1k session the week after that, TSS for the entire session was 75 based on Pace, 79 based on power or 76 based on HR. TRIMP was 120. So any form of TSS is just over double for an average training session for me, compared to a 5k . Whereas TRIMP is exactly double comparing the two. So long term there's probably not much difference in using any of these. I'm just all in favour of picking any metric you like and just collecting the data accurately. As in, making sure you update paces, HR zones, power etc to your latest fitness, on a regular basis. I think if you do this, whether it be TSS in all 3 forms we have talked about here, or TRIMP, you will learn something from your own training and fitness. As I've said before, it's only really useful for yourself. Just because my training load metric is higher than someone else, doesn't mean anything. It's worth nothing.

TSB in that period ranges from -1 to about -8. Obviously you have to do more, to ramp up your CTL. One thing I've been very good over the years is how to increase the load very slowly, almost so it's unnoticeable in terms of impact on the body, but as the weeks and months go on you will see small performance increases.

The point is to just track what you are doing so that you know how you can consistently do as much as possible. Lactate, HR, pace are all tools.

But my initial success, I was exactly the same amount of time on feet, going 3x sub threshold versus the classic training approach. As in some vo2 work, tempo and some straight threshold. You know the usual. The sub threshold way creates a greater training load a week, hence why I believe it works. You can simply do more in the quality zone. I spoke about this right near the start I think, will be on an early page. But basically, my CTL was capped on the previous approach, I just couldn't get it any higher in the time I had. Until I started pushing the envelope to as much load as I could handle every other day, whilst still recovering. FWIW yes, there's more minutes of quality making the difference. But that's only because there is no vo2 max to recovery from, apart from the parkruns. That's the whole point of those you train in a sub threshold zone that gives you pretty good training benefits, versus not going over it where the recovery time seems to ramp up, totally unproportionally compared to the training benefit gain.",

It's not enough to run 1,5-3 mmol thresholds to get the best bang for your bucks. You need to go 3-4 mmol every lactate threshold and to teach your body to extend the total length of distance runned. You are time limited and need to do the best out of it and therefore need high quality without higher risk of injury. A low mileage runner never have to be afraid of overtraining as long as not going too fast in sessions. Individual perfect pace is the way to go....",

So this is interesting to me. To clarify a few of your other posts, are you saying when you hit a new high point in CTL you expect to PB? Are you predicting it? And then you can also look back in historical data and plot previous PBs and what your CTL was? I believe you got the nail on head when you say before most people issue, I would guess 90% + can't detail anything from the PMC as they probably don't have correct zones or even know them.",
