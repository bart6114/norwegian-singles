The section of putting this into practice seems to be a lot of what yourself , shirtboy, sirpoc have been saying. Whilst training on this lower intensity, it doesn't quite give as good adaptations minute for minute BUT you can do way more of it because of the reduction of fatigue. It's really quite simple when you think about it. I think this is what links into on a more simple scale and non lactate testing, the use of the PMC as sirpoc has suggested. I was incredibly skeptical of this as first. However I have spent a week going back over things and injecting current fitness retrospectively as I had pbs to go on, so my data collection was pretty accurate. Things to note here. Firstly, it's clearly harder to score as much TSS when you do the zone 4-5 stuff. Point 2, threshold was easy to score TSS, I didn't feel tired during these blocks either yet you can see my CTL increasing and then maybe a few weeks after that, it's created a higher load and I've pb'd on multiple occasions. Note here, this was not my design, just chance that I sometimes do the odd threshold block to mix things up. But these based on my view of the pmc in training peaks, clearly is getting me the best results. I hope I get the term correct, CTL, TSS etc are very new to me and I've learned them from this thread. Sirpoc, I hope you don't mind me following you on Strava, seems a few others have. But I have to say looking back through your recent stuff and Kristoffers, it's hard to not be tempted into me committing to this from now until the new year. What I can see with both of you is that this is not a short term fix, but you both have clearly ramped it up on a tiny scale week by week, month by month but both clearly are staying healthy and getting stronger and stronger. I no longer have the luxury of 10+ hour weeks so this is an incredibly tempting way for me to try.",

We've said before, there's many factors as why you can push a higher HR in racing than training. Considering virtually all of your running will be in training, it makes sense to just use Friel's test as the LTHR jump off point. Heart rate isn't the best for this type of training, but it's not horrible. If you then just use Friels zones, literally just aim for 80-90% of the time of your intervals (say 30 mins total) somewhere in his sun threshold zone. Will this be perfect? No. Will you get the majority of the training benefits? Probably you will. Just make sure you stay in this friel zone.

Some of many examples of this fast improvement was a couple of years ago when I coached an Irish master runner then age 43 on just low mileage and 5 sessions per week . He had family and 2 kids and worked often nights at a shift job. He did mostly one threshold interval per week . When I started to coach he had a best of 16:30 @ 5000m . After 2 months with this low mileage , lactate thresholds @ half marathon pace and 5 sessions per week he ran a 15:37 5000m. Some time after I had been the coach he told me he had kept on his own with the threshold intervals at half marathon pace and he was happy to tell he ran a 1:12. half marathon. I just say it to everyone who wants to listen to this advice it's most effective to directly point to the most effective threshold pace close to half marathon race pace. It's not a tough pace when you run it at reps 400-3000m. and after some time you quite easily can perform them in one session up to 16k/ 10 miles total and even more sometimes.

For a while it was an hour, then he doubled down on the fact that it was the power a rider could sustain in a 40km time trial (which is what he said 20 years ago and has now gone back to) This is where issues start IMO. As the time for that can be very different, for a large number of reasons. For example, I have an insanely low CDA, so the time it takes me to complete a 40km time trial in about 48 minutes, isn't that reflective in my opinion that my talent level means , that's how long it should take me. Secondly, I don't really like how normalised power works. In fact I don't like it at all. There's too many ways to trick the system. There's easily ways if you go outside and hit the hills, where you can do training sessions that hit TSS of over 100 per hour. Normalised power \"busters\". Not sure I really like TSB either. But, Coggan's reply is always it's been 20 years and is there a better system? The man is arrogant , but, he does have a point. But then he tries to be clever and say people are idiots for calling them zones, that they are \"training levels\". But other things as well, he will say the rest doesn't matter for example of vo2 max sessions, I've seen him claim before. Or he will not really explain why TSS probably under represents these sessions or dismissive of the evidence or the much greater fatigue they produce (therefore TSB). Also how he dismisses the aerolab in Golden Cheetah, despite myself and others having great success with it. In my opinion he doesn't understand it. But his science background can't accept hobby cyclists in the UK know more than him (which I would 100% stand by, even if I didn't understand the science behind it, I for sure knew how to analyse the data to reduce my cda and make myself faster). The fact that he's supposed to be a scientist, but is an online troll lol some of his distain to others. For example , mention Seiler to him \"what Seiler does for a living, I do as a hobby\" (referencing the fact, this actually, isn't the direct field he has most of his published papers in). Basically he's just a weird man. That's all off the top of my head . He is clearly a really clever guy, but I don't know what he brings to the table at this point. I think, personally, someone who has the real time, drive and understanding could make a better system than the current one. Maybe even something running specific.

    "msg": "Great thread, thanks everyone for the contributions. I've been doing something a similar but a little easier than many of you here since this spring - each week a time-based threshold workout like (8x(3',1'), 6x(4',1'), 16x(1',1'), etc), a mini workout like 75' with 30-45' steady or 10x45\" hill reps, and then a easy/steady long run, on ~45mpw. The mini workout is a newer addition, I used to just run easy 75 mins. \"Problem\" is the paces are much slower than I'd think are reasonable. For example this spring most of the 3-5 min reps were around 6:50 pace but I raced 10mi at 6:30/mi (with a pretty strong negative split too) so that was a bit slower than hm pace. And now in the summer it's more like 7-7:15. The workouts feel like a decent effort, happy to be done them and I'm tired the next day but not like \"beat up\". No clue about lactate - as far as HR, it is maybe just getting to threshold HR in the last rep or two, but usually a bit lower. Most of the 10mi race was at ~175bpm and the intervals are typically in the 165-175 range. I run the workouts by effort though and check HR after. The minute reps are the only ones that line up pretty well with races, longer reps fall off even more. And my easy pace is very slow, 9-10 min/mi avg typically, maybe finishing an easy run in the mid 8s if weather is good. A 45 mile week takes me 7 hours. So I'm guessing its mostly just an endurance problem. I ran a 3:18 marathon in '21 and probably am not a whole lot better now, certainly not 3:00 like vdot suggests. Are these paces slow enough that it's a problem? Seems lots of people train slower than they race but this seems excessive. It seems like the workouts aren't progressing, even though there is no way I could have done that 1:05 10mi race a couple months prior. Is it time to move to 2 of these workouts a week? Tried it a little bit ago and ended up pretty tired after just 1.5 weeks. Not exactly sure about current fitness, doing a 5k in mid October to get a better idea. Have a trail half marathon in a couple weeks so didn't want to do a time trial yet. But ultimately training for a november marathon.",

Point 2, yes you don't need a lactate meter to do sub threshold sessions but using heart rate has deficiencies due to the lag. I would go off effort/pace. For example KI's 5 x 2000m on the treadmill for 1.9 lactate was at 3:35/km which is slower than his half marathon race pace of 3:28/km.

I haven't fully gotten my brain around some of the maths earlier in the thread though. If you move from a 17min 5k -> 16 min 5k and update your threshold zones appropriately, am I right in saying 5x2k at a similar relative threshold level would product the same TSS? This makes me feel like you'd end up with the same long term CTL doing the same workouts at the same relative threshold (even though you will be doing all the workouts faster as a 16min 5k runner), but from your statement I would have thought CTL would be higher when you're running 16 vs 17 mins.",

If you get faster and are running the same workout at the same relative intensity, (i.e. 5*2000m at say 0.95 Intensity Factor) your TSS will actually be lower, since TSS is a function of time and intensity factor. Therefore, your CTL will eventually decrease as well, all else the same. This will be marginal though and it will take a while to appear, as CTL is a 42 day weighted average. You'd notice a change in ATL more prominently, since that's just a 7 day weighted average. So, if you're chasing CTL (as opposed to performance), you have to either increase the time spent running at the same intensity factor or run the same duration at a higher intensity factor, in order to see an increase long term. The obvious reason that you would want a higher CTL is that it means you're doing more work, relative to your previous training. Like mileage though, there is a component of diminishing return. Meaning, you can keep bumping up your CTL and not necessarily see an improvement in performance, even though you are imposing more stress/load.

Obviously if you stayed at 9x1k forever, and ran it at 15k pace , you would always get the same CTL. In fact, it might even decrease as the time it takes would get faster. But this is where I talk about, gradually increasing over time. So I make a big fitness jump, I need to run faster for the easy run, for the same CTL, but I've gone from easy run being 45 mins, to 50 mins, then 55 mins and now at roughly 60 mins. This will slowly increase your load. Same with the reps. I started off doing 8x1k I'm at 10x1k. My 3x3k has become 3x3200 and so on. I hope that makes sense. For example , I'm creating TSS now of 460 ish a week, maybe 6 months ago it was 400. Over say a 6 week period, my CTL might increase maybe by 3-4 points. That doesn't sound like much, but over time it really adds up. This I'm my opinion, is why this is so sustainable. I would say on this system and singles, 8+ hours is about the limit.",

Going to keep doing this until I either stall out or need to up mileage for a long race or something. First month did about 30 min of work per session. Second month shot for 31. Next month I‚Äôll do 32. And so on. Hobbyjogger Ingebrigtsen seems to be topping off at around 45 min of work per session.

Just run a 5k or 10k and I've been using the rough guide someone posted up in this thread summary some pages back and it's just about right for me with lactate testing to check. 15k pace for 1k reps gets me nice to where I want. Basically just run a 5 or 10k race and just calculate it from that. Same with my 3k reps. Just run HM pace or a touch slower. I mean really why to try over complicate yet another arbitratory debatable physiological point? I will search for the Strava group, sounds interesting. Thank you everyone.",
