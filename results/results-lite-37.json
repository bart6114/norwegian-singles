But in my opinion Strava account could be providing false flag operation. But onto subject in hand. Just about any known coaching plan for athletes running around 16 or under or to have a chance to run that will obviously include some specificity for the event and plenty of VO2 stimulus.

Like, what gain does someone have to fake a whole method and strava training account? His race results are definitely real, you can find them on websites, so he is elaborately just faking training, just cause? He gains nothing from all this work. Also, who says doing 3 sub-threshold workouts a week and aerobic easy running isn't VO2 stimulus? Gutting VO2Max workouts and running at faster than 5k pace is not the only way to get VO2Max stimulus... Obviously you improve baseline VO2Max slowly but surely doing any kind of other aerobic work. Specific VO2Max workouts are just stuffing big stimulus into one single session at the cost of recovery time. So what's there not to believe that you slowly improve all aspects of running fitness by just stacking workouts and volume and following this method? No one here is saying it's the fastest or most effective method, but it is certainly safe, mundane, routine and easy to do, and slowly but surely does work for a super wide general population of all speeds, with many success stories, making it viable to try out for anyone just running to improve. Lowkey you're the one that doesn't seem like a real person lmao. \"I can't see how SirPoc hasn't got injured following a training plan so dumb\" - What, so you'd expect less injury risk if he was doing weekly reps at faster than mile pace and VO2Max workouts, with strides? I dunno about you, but the faster and more straining something is slightly higher chance of injury. I don't see how 3 chill workouts and easy pace for everything else is injury risking. Not quick improvement, sure, but no one ever preaches this method for fast results. \"I don't think anyone could have trained the same way for so long and made progress\" - He has made progress he can train this way for so long. He can train this way for so long he hasn't got injured. He hasn't got injured this method is safer and easier and more mundane than incorporating speed, VO2Max, and getting too excited. Slow and steady. How can't you understand this basic logic flow?",

If you want to get faster in 4 weeks hard sessions will certainly do that.

The details of any training scheme emerge from the application of general principles to specific constraints and goals. Part of understanding any training method is understanding the parameters of the athlete it is designed for. There is a lot of useless debate that stems from people not understanding or disregarding these parameters. People are trying to compare or modify pieces of this method to different methods that have a different set of constraints and goals -they are trying to plant different crops in the wrong growing conditions. To the point ningkaiyang is making: this method is giving up some aspects of hypothetically optimal training in favor of the more practical reality that a lot of rec runners are operating within. It's building in a some common sense and risk mitigation into the method itself. Yes if we properly execute and recover from more specificity/intensity we will see more improvement, but the reality is that as intensity increases it's easier to screw something up. The mechanical and metabolic strain scales non-linearly. We're looking at marginal gains vs shrinking a margin of error. Expanding the crop analogy: A lot of training plans are asking people to grow a lot of different crops, including some plants that come from tropical environments regardless of the growing conditions they are working with. We'll have a more varied diet but theres a good chance some of your crops fail and we don't get as much food in the long run. This method flips that and asks \"how do we reliably grow the most food in the in the soil and climate we're already working with?\" The diet might be more boring but at least we'll be well fed. There's still room for variety, maybe we add some native berries (strides), we can seasonly rotate crops (using shorter or longer threshold rep schemes to target different paces), but the point is that we fit to the ecosystem we're in. Okay not sure where I'm going with this but I think ya'll get the point. I am curious though. What is the fastest results anyone here is aware of with strict adherence to this method or similar? Doesn't need to be the exact scheme but at least threshold-ish only workouts, no X-factor/VO2max/whatever, only specificity comes from racing. Strides are allowed.",

He also trains the same almost exclusively in the sirpoc method. Which, in my opinion, it should be called. Norwegian Singles method is too broad and people are way over complicating it. If we just name it after sirpoc, we can just say 'go look at his Strava' and honestly within 5 mins scrolling you will have worked out the fundamentals. I think the remarkable thing about this method though is how many testimonials we have seen from 19-22 min runners. Who have broke through in some cases half a decade or more of stagnation training the more traditional methods, growing many different crops in your analogy. Some guys have been training for 5-10 years and suddenly this has allowed them to increase load in a way they never ever have been able to prescribe before, knocking minutes off even 5k times. That is what is quite striking, almost shocking when you see past who is fastest and look at the at times absolutely staggering progress some are making. There was a guy who posted on Reddit in depth and it was a really cool, informative post. Whilst he isn't fast in the bigger picture, his improvement is almost unbelievable.

If you are going to go all in on this method though, one race in the grand scheme is just a blip. You are looking to build more and more and more. Yes, you might not perfectly built for that 5k, but long term you just kept building with a tiny taper. Sure, you might give up a few seconds without that specific race preparation or sharpening, but you are also still back to it a day or so later and you are still in the same phase of just being able to just continue to do the same thing, over and over. The next 5k or the one after that, you have continued to build more and not interrupt training with doing anything sub optimal, for the long term build. The increase in speed will naturally just come with the increase in pushing up the threshold from below. If you look at some of the stuff sirpoc has shared on Strava, it's fascinating. The CTL to performance graph was insanely insightful and has certainly worked out the way he's intended. I will say though, it takes a huge step out of ones comfort zone and is a huge leap of faith for people, including myself, who are used to those 8, 12, 16 week builds to something specific. The other advantage is whilst you never completely master one distance, you are pretty darn good across a broad range. I think there's a huge argument that's the main benefit here for the hobbyist and I don't think that's mentioned enough. It's hard to get your head around. But if you are thinking ahead to just one particular race, a more traditional build is perfectly fine, but there's only so many times you can do that without having those peaks and troughs way too familiar to most us. That to me, seems to be the trap a lot of people have gotten into and why, as questioned above, so many people seem to have broken through a plateau when really trying to do this style of training as close to 1:1 as originally laid out as possible. I'll put myself in the group a lot have others have admitted, my skeptical nature was pretty high on this, which turned to curiosity. That in turn, turned to why not. Now, I'm unashamedly in the camp of thinking, for th average hobby jogger this is probably the absolute smartest way to train. Someone questioned above, why would one train like this so boring and long term? I can only give my opinion. But I never in my life came close to my modest target of breaking 36. I think a lot of people's focus is the 5k but mine has always been 10k. I had pretty much tried all avenues and always got a mid 36 at best. I've been on the Strava group and followed everything as closely as I can. I ran 34.26 last weekend. I can't lie, I had a boring 7 months of a slow, steady but very doable build . But, who cares?

Last year I pulled a peak week of 3x1600m @ 4:58, then next day 10mi steady @ 5:52, next day 8x400 @ 64, then 5x800 @ 2:20 in back to back days no resting, thinking I would get faster because I was following a training plan created by some pro runner in the 1970s - what a waste of all that grit haha. I'd built up to 70mpw during base and then dropped it to like 45mpw to handle the brunt of back-to-back workouts in my training plan. I hit some impressive ones early on like 5x1600m @ 5:05 at 10k effort, but then as season went later I was struggling more and more and racing my workouts harder and harder. There was also other stupid stuff like 2x2400m @ sub 5:00 pace, then the next day 3mi 'tempo' at 5:15. I was really racing each one, balls to the wall, looking back on it. 4 days (insanely short taper lol) after my peak week of 4 back to back workouts, I time trialled a 9:50 3200m and a week later a 4:36 1600m, and then my season was completely spent. NOT what I was looking for, 7 months of training harder than I did in high school just to not PR (even tho could've been in better shape cause time trials vs racing, it wasn't that much better) and based on what could have been possible based on some of the workouts, had I spaced them out and recovered reasonably. So I guess I'm hoping to join the list of success stories this season and get up there and prove this method doesn't only work for old guys lol. Maybe break 32min in the track 10k. I reckon speed and VO2max aren't really my problem with the anaerobic workouts I was handling last year, and working my threshold entirely for a few months will provide good results. Although, since I'll be traveling for a large bit over summer, I will attempt to do a peak build with some 10k-specific work in the four weeks before one final race and a few weeks off, which will definitely deviate from SirPoc method. But keeping to the SirPoc's ideals, my key workouts/X-factors will basically be once every two-three weeks once I'm a few months into only sub-T training, replacing the third sub-T session maybe shortening the long run to facilitate recovery. I'm also doing a few relaxed 200s on full recovery after some threshold workouts to stay in touch with speed. But I've been following the 3 sub-T workouts and running slow on easy days to a tee so far and I'm 3 weeks into the season (after 2 weeks off) at my lifetime highest mileage (75mpw third week back is a lil crazy haha) and it's feeling sustainable, so I'm going to buckle up at 60-70s and see where this leads me. 🙏",

My marathon variation is to keep with 2 x sub T during the week (10x3 and 5x6) but double up on the long runs at the weekend with the first run including a subT effort. On Saturday I will do the 3x10 as part of a long run. Progressively increase length of the long run and when within the run I will do the 3x10. So at the start of the cycle it will be at the start of the run (like a normal session) and toward the end of cycle at the end of the run I plan on the run being 2.5hrs max, or I will go with a straight steady effort (load should be about the same regardless without burning me out) and then on the Sunday keep a 90mins 65%mas max run. This is the closest I can think to getting loading in the right ballpark without over doing it, depending on how I go I might add marathon effort for longer workout eg 3x15 (which sirpoc said left him tired) so trial and error on my part. it may work, it may not work but the best thing about this method if I find I’m not hitting the regularly workout it’s very easy to see and then make adjustments without compromising you training block.",

They are still aerobically underdeveloped and improving. 5k pace work is just an unnecessary complication to the mix, for relatively little short term gain, in the face of the long term bigger picture. I would also disagree. The general consensus is more traditional training plans for users of this thread, whilst they provide some results, the blocky nature of them with these builds and peaks, ends up with a very choppy level of fitness after and you just repeat and get back to the same point after another block. I know I was trained as much as the coaches I had or training plans given would allow. I was absolutely fried and at the limit of what my body could usually cope with. 90% of stuff coaches have used with me, are no more or less than classic training with a staple of harder easy runs, 5k repeats and straight tempos. Quite simply, it was too much to recover from on a full time job, life etc. I agree, it certainly made me not well trained for the previous 6.5 years before switching to this. But, that's more a fault of what the traditional coaching and running methods, not my execution of it. I did everything I was told. It's of course not this method in itself that has made me go from 19:21 to 17xx, it's understanding some of mainstream coaching for hobby joggers doesn't make sense. I don't think I've seen sirpoc claim once, there is any particular secret to sub threshold in itself . Yet, what he has laid out seems to be a pretty darn good approach if you want to just plug and play and have a really good shot at finally getting past that peak, build, burnout and do it all over again. I'll take the maybe giving up a few seconds in not sharpening up my first 5k of the season for the fact I know now from last year, sticking to this after the first race that sharpening will be there anyway and i can also just continue to log my miles, do my runs, week in, week out. 5k through HM we don't even massively need to debate at this point. As above, the marathon is worth a real look into and someone really following through with this but also honest pacing on race day. I've seen a couple of people train like this on Strava, but then suicide race pacing means we have no idea if their plan worked or not? There's obviously an argument for shorter track sharpening, especially the mile.

I think it could for some individuals but there are many runners who smoothly transition from 5k/10k to HM, but when they transition to the full marathon they find out it's a different beast. I think I'll start with the normal method, having the 3 sessions distinct from the long run, and I'll keep the long run relatively short by marathon standards. But I think the right thing to do is to eventually combine the long run with the long intervals and make it a 2 hour day. And then personally, in the final stretch before the race, I'd like to do some long MP tempos. So that week would start like normal with two threshold sessions, then instead of doing the normal 3rd session, you turn it into a long MP tempo instead. The following week you drop a threshold session and maybe reduce the other threshold session, just to be safe about recovery. I'd personally want to do 3 of those. 8-9 weeks out, 5-6 weeks out, and 2-3 weeks out. When you add up the time at pace, you'd still be getting in about the same. For example, if you are normally doing 4x10min that day and instead you do 80min continuous, you've done +40 than normal that day. Then you drop a threshold session afterwards to recover, so you get back to close to net 0. If you drop/reduce another session, only then are you negative in total time at workout pace. So for a traditional 2 marathons a year schedule (~26 weeks of training), you take 4 weeks recovery/easy, you have 13 weeks of grinding out the method, and at the end you have 9 weeks where you compromise the method a bit to work on race specificity and taper. 5k/10k runners get to just run more races for their specificity. Anyway I'll get to it and try to remember to report back at the end of the year. Good luck everyone.",

It's been decades already that exercise scientists and top coaches have suspected/known that chasing vo2max gains is not the way to reach your full potential. Once it reaches a certain point, it's not very heavily tied to performance and is not a performance metric worth chasing. I think it was in a Steve Magness video I heard Paula Radcliffe's vo2max, which was tested a lot, did not change from her late teens to her peak. Even if you set her marathon aside, she also improved massively at 5k. edit: I wouldn't rule out that vo2max training is useful early on in one's career (although I wouldn't bet on it either).

Your goal should be to increase this as much as you can, even though you won't be increasing it much as this system is not promoting overload at all. It's not the perfect metric, but works well to measure against yourself as you are doing the same thing over and over. It's actually the opposite, your performance shouldn't plateau over a reasonable ish period, because you have increased load. If you think about it in terms of every 6-8 weeks, it'll give you an idea. Sirpoc shared something on Strava which was the absolute biggest eye opener to me, it was roughly linear and a graph of his CTL and 5k performance. It was cool to see, as it was over the around 2 straight years he's been training like this. Coggan gets a ton on internet forums and his stuff still works well, whilst he never intended any of this to be converted to rTSS etc. I can only imagine, someone like sirpoc who obviously knew how to make it work with power data, has adapted it well in my opinion to how it can be applied to a hobby jogger. It's also another reason for my money as to why you shouldn't deviate away too much from the paces sirpoc laid out. There's a corridor where rTSS seems to represent very well that he has hit upon. The harder runs , let's say a 5k pace is clearly underrepresent and it's harder than the rTSS model thinks. On the flip side, really easy running is probably easier than it represents. The big thing here though, is if you roughly stick to 75%-25% and split in the easy paces suggested and roughly around sub threshold paces suggested, even if the rTSS scores aren't exact, the repeatable nature will even out and you can compare apples and oranges with yourself. Say you throw in 5k repeats regular, you would have to keep doing them long term, as they will give you a far less rTSS score than you deserve. If it's not part of your regular schedule, over time it'll distort the data. But you also have to remember, the absolute CTL value is irrelevant to compare person to person. I went into this thinking it was pretty simple, but it's actually not as easy as you might think. If you have not got understanding how you can use all the data you can collect, you won't know where to go next. I've picked up a lot of what sirpoc has said on Strava lately.

Other than that, he did 3 x 60 easy, 90 min long run, 3 x3200, 6 x 1600 and 10x1k. The paces changed as fitness improved but the number of hours remained pretty constant.

This sounds like not a lot, it isn't, but the performance also increase in that year in smooth fashion. Gains become harder to get for him the second year training like this.

But all the data you have ever put in, contributes to it, just the further you go back the less weight it carries. It takes a long time, but eventually for the most part your CTL will just become your TSS average for the previous 42 days. But imagine you started at zero, the way it works is let's say you did 100 TSS a day. After 42 days your CTL would be 63.7. It would take you 316 days to finally reach a rounded figure of 100 CTL. After that, your choices are do more intensity, do longer durations, or both. If you stick to 100 TSS at that point, in simplistic terms , then you have plataued. I've mentioned before, this is why the second year I trained like this, the gains have been harder to get. You have to be creative and try and do more. But still, essentially every session ever still contributes, it's just the stuff i did 2 years ago is now minuscule in the calculation. I will also add, it's probably only useful if you are trying to compare like for like. If you are really mixing up your training outside of what I am doing, rTSS probably isn't going to tell you the whole story anyway. The consistency of it (much like with power) seems to really work around the sub-threshold level. Of course, I have said before probably easy runs are over represented in rTSS. But again, assuming you roughly run them at the same % of intensity relative to your current fitness you input, it'll stay consistently over represented in time, so doesn't really matter if our intention is just to use it as a practical tool (which is all I care about). I'll happily leave the science to the much smarter guys than me. It's likely why the graph I shared on Strava fit so neatly, in terms of load versus performance, because my sessions are still for the most part comparible in intensity going right back (with a few changes to sneak in extra load) but also a decent invease in overall training time. In absolute simple terms , my daily average per session a year ago was 60 TSS per week and now it's 70. There's probably no real suprise that I'm fitter now, because I'm doing the same thing with a sprinkle of pushing the limits of sub threshold intensity, or just more or the same but longer.

    "msg": "I live in North Carolina and it’s pretty insufferable in the summer, though not as bad as Texas. My plan is to workout in the mornings, slow down a bit and extend the rest period to keep body temperature controlled. This is a great question though and I don’t think there’s a perfect answer except control what you can control. However, I don’t think I’m better off going by rpe in the summer. If I standardize the time of day I run and how to adjust paces, I think that would be good enough to get the work in consistently.",

Chillruns idea of early as you can in the day, certainly worked for my easy runs where I could control HR to under 70% of max. I used that as my upper limit, as even in the morning that comes before 65% of MAS in sirpoc guide. For the workouts, investing in a lactate meter massively helped, as I could do a step test in good conditions then translate the paces outside. Again though, RPE is without doubt the worst marker here. The best solution is the workouts on the treadmill. I have managed to make this system work. I think ultimately, if you want to you could? But I accept , it requires a level of extra effort. xemptyzI don't think though many people would have much success with sirpoc's method, unless you have some way to keeo things consistent and measurable. Ultimately this is what creates the understanding of what you are doing, keeps you from going to hard but helps you understand how to quantify and build loads. There's no magic pill here, but I've learned that I can build all these things in, even despite my poor running environment and I set my HM PB after years of trying to break 1:15 just recently. Massively thankful to this thread and obviously sirpoc specifically. Best of running everyone.",

    "msg": "Nice posts guys. I will add in good conditions it's the opposite effect. RPE had me going too hard. 7-8 is where my workouts would sit and there's something that sirpoc said that set off alarm bells for me. That his workouts were 5-6 normally. I had read the thread thinking there's no way I can do 3 workouts a week at what I was doing, mostly by feel. On hindsight, just running on feel was stupid. You often feel a million dollars until you don't. The paces are only a fraction slower than what I was doing, but the RPE and ability to workout 3 days a week is there. The structure is there for a reason to what sirpoc84 does, but took me a while to see it.",

    "msg": "I'm digging into this approach a bit, sorry if this has been asked. -What is the purpose of the variation in rep schemes and paces, in the context of this program? I am looking at some recommendations (I don't remember if I saw them here, reddit, or the strava group) that say to alternate 12x3min, 9x4min, 6x6min, 4x9min reps between 15k, HM, and 30k pace, all with 1-minute jog, as a starting point. It seems to me like: -The pace variations there are so tight as to not make much of a difference, or even be possible to dial in that precisely (presuming road training). -Physiologically, what's the difference between 3/6/9 minute intervals, all with 1 minute jog rest? The goal of all of these workouts is to give an overall threshold stimulus, with rest for lactate to come down. It's not like they're really giving any different stimuli. I understand the point of a wide range of paces and rep schemes in a system like daniels or 5-pace, but this is a very simple and focused program without a wide range of paces and rep schemes, we're just splitting hairs on a tight range. If a runner were to run all of their workouts at 8x4min30sec, roughly between T and M pace, what would be the downside? Just getting bored?",

But still only makes up part of the bigger picture. I think most people who have really had success training like this, will know what I mean. Anyway, I'm glad and genuinely pleased so many people have enjoyed this thread. Maybe it'll die one day and give me a break ha ha it's a out of control, but now we are I guess into the thousands based on the Strava group alone, I suppose that has to be a good thing.
