Before I could even open my mouth he turned to me, and I guess assumed I worked there, and asked if the cherries or blackcurrants were better at buffering lactate. I said \"umm I don't know\" and then clarified why I had come over. He just answered every question I had with \"umm I don't know\" and then eventually ripped open the berries and poured them into a bag of frozen peas he had in his basket and just winked at me and whispered \"arbitrage\". I saw him 10 minutes later at the checkout holding up the line by telling the 61 year old lady about his 10k time and how staying below LT2 was the secret to it all. I don't really think she even said anything, but was just being polite to a customer. He saw me nearby and then abruptly pointed at me and yelled at the store manager who was like 40 meters away that I was a bad employee who didn't know anything about the store. He paid for his shopping with a travellers cheque, turned to the guy behind him and said \"Brazil Nuts are the key\", shoved all his food into a backpack and then just shuffled out of the store yelling out lactate numbers at random intervals through the parking lot.",

Initially I was a little underwhelmed by his half marathon result compared to his recent 10k, and took that to mean that this method may be better for 5k/10k than for the half and probably a bit less effective for the full marathon. His 10k of 30:41 corresponds to a VDOT of 70.9, while his half marathon 1:08:50 only corresponds to a VDOT of 69.5. Looking more closely at it however, I’d say the significant elevation gain on this course is worth at least a minute vs a flatter course, putting the performance much more in line with his 10k. In addition, he won by over a minute, so he clearly ran solo the whole way. He also won his 10k, but it looks like there were a few people he would have been running with for most of the race. Given the rule of thumb of drafting being worth ~3 minutes in a marathon, and there being plenty of people to run with at London, it should be a much more optimal environment for running fast. Barring a major fueling issue (unlikely given his usual methodical planning as well as his cycling background) or some unforeseen muscle cramping, I expect him to run 2:20-2:24 at London, with an outside shot of going under 2:20. I don’t want to set expectations too high, as even 2:29 or so is quite impressive for a debut and wouldn’t take away anything from all he’s accomplished so far. I’m curious to see what he does next after the marathon and when, if ever, he’ll run into the ceiling of improvement from this method.",
