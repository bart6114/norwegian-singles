As for cardiac drift, as I said many times before, it is simply a fact of life, both below and above so-called \"LT1\" (although of course greater at higher vs. lower intensities). Consider, for example, this classic study by Gunnar Ahlborg: Despite the fact that the participants were exercising at only 30% of VO2max (not really much above a fast walk), such that lactate concentrations never rose significantly above resting levels, HR rose from 104 beats/min after 40 min of exercise to 129 beats/min after 240 min. Of course, training diminishes cardiac drift, such that you might not see such a large change in more highly trained individuals (although note that VO2peak while cycling averaged 52+/5 mL/min/kg in these non-cyclists, meaning that their VO2max was 55-60 mL/min/kg). Nonetheless, what these (and numerous other) data demonstrate is that there is really no connection between changes in blood lactate and cardiac drift (nor would you expect one in the first place).

Look at the paper i shared (Stoa, 2020), where Elite athletes have a VO2max in the range of 4.42 +- 1.15 L/min, 71.2 +-8.3ml/kg/min. That is a big range.

Fiber type may be one contributing factor, but it's mostly about muscle respiratory capacity. In that regard, a trained individual who has more type II fibers can very well be superior to an untrained person with lots of type I fibers. Running economy has nothing to do with Noakes' flawed hypothesis of a \"central governor\". Instead, it most closely related to things like leg spring stiffness, the distance between the ankle joints and the insertion of the Achilles tendon, etc. IOW, more the biophysics of tissue properties than motor control. Finally, part of the reason that it is difficult to sort out these factors is that they are interrelated, making any distinctions somewhat arbitrary. Again, consider muscle respiratory capacity: on the one hand, it is the key determinant of the metabolic response to exercise (\"threshold\"), but on the other it likely also influences VO2max, by helping maintain O2 extraction despite reduced capillary mean transit time.

    "msg": "As has been known for decades, muscle mitochondria aren't separate little \"footballs\". Rather, they exist in an interconnected reticulum, which is undergoing constant and surprisingly (to some) rapid fusion and fission. It is therefore really a mistake to think in terms of the size or number of mitochondria - what matters is the overall volume. Be that as it may, the primary effect of endurance training is simply to increase the overall quantity of enzymes, cytochromes, etc., involved in cellular respiration. In part, this is due to a greater density of christae, i.e., for a given mitochondrial volume more of the necessary elements are packed into a more elaborated inner membrane. Secondarily, however, training does have a small impact on mitochondrial \"quality\" (properties), such that skeletal muscle mitochondria more closely resemble those found in the heart (no, Jane, a mitochondrion is not a mitochondrion is not a mitochondrion). Holloszy's classic studies first reported and described this in the late 1960s, it is just a point frequently overlooked by the emphasis on expansion of the overall mitochondrial volume. In any case , I am clueless as to why you think this really has anything to do with food intake/resting metabolic rate. Non-contracting muscle uses very little ATP, with the heart, liver, and kidneys together demanding as much O2/blood flow as all muscles in the body combined. As for the Norwegians, I haven't really paid any more attention to how they train than I do any other athletes (i.e., essentially none). My impression from threads like this one, though, is they do a lot of what I would call \"sweetspot\" training. Quelle surprise, of course, because the latter is really nothing more than the cogent application of exercise training principles like specificity and overload.",

I’m not a research scientist and haven’t done the best at utilizing the learning from my genetics and cell bio degree in a professional capacity, but I still think I have enough knowledge in physiology to get the gist of what’s going on here and how it may apply to running training. From my limited view, calling this study “All time champion” of anything related to the topics discussed in this thread seems laughable to me. The study: What was measured: What wasn’t done (at least from my limited view into the study): They took six poorly trained guys and made them train very hard for five months, the guys demonstrated massive improvement in certain muscle characteristics, but how much of this is relevant in the context of reasonably well-trained distance runners looking to optimize performance within an existing workload? I fail to understand how anything in this study invalidates my earlier statement: “The specific stimulus of keeping a long easy effort helps develop metabolic flexibility and general capacity in the mitochondria that only faster running probably doesn't accomplish.” From what I can see there’s nothing to demonstrate that they wouldn’t have done as well or better with different training methods, or that this isn’t just all noobie gains of making unfit people train hard consistently. From what I can see the study has nothing to do with any concept of metabolic flexibility, nor can demonstrate one way or the other what good training methods are for developing metabolic flexibility. What is the actual comparison of SDH in these subjects to the elite runners that you reference? What I’ve found so far is pretty inconsistent, but is generally still higher than what the participants in the Gollnick study achieved. How relevant is an increase of SDH in a muscle biopsy if we aren't connecting it to actual performance or comparing other training methods? My understanding is that our methods to see what's going on in the mitochondria are pretty limited in how they correlate to actual performance.

On the second, what this study clearly demonstrates is that large volumes of low to moderate intensity exercise are neither required nor most time-efficient for increasing muscle respiratory capacity. It, along with a wealth of other literature, disproves the common misconception that lower intensity exercise is a greater stimulus for mitochondrial biogenesis, as you initially claimed/implied (same is true for capillarization...if you want lots of capillaries, at least to a point you need to train harder but shorter, not longer but easier). TL,DR: As anyone working in the field knows, Holloszy's famous \"two-fold\" increase in muscle mitochondrial enzyme activities in rats is difficult to match in humans, but this study managed to do so, despite the fact that the participants were only training 4 h/wk.

Is some of the \"best\" stuff physiologists can bring to the table really just a protocol that made six unfit 30s Pullman guys into averagely fit guys by making them train hard on a bike 4x /week? But there's no performance outcome, nothing the average person cares about, just an increase in some enzymes in small pieces of muscle. If it's so difficult to match Holloszy's \"two-fold\" increase from the rat studies maybe we should question if a study on six dudes in Pullman really demonstrates any semblance of a reliable protocol to match that or if other factors may be contributing to such an exceptional result. Meanwhile real world coaches and athletes are running experiments on a much larger scale and at a much higher level. I've ran some pretty intense experiments in Pullman myself, sometimes alongside six other dudes, sometimes a few more dudes, on the real dirt/grass/track, where real results matter. We didn't take muscle biopsies but I'd bet the wheat farm that our SDH was higher than anyone in that study. Maybe what I said was about long runs and mitochondria was wrong?

Intuitively it seems like the solution to this would be either race into mental shape or throw in a few continuous tempos -for me throwing in a couple hilly continuous tempos toughened me up fairly well, though obviously thats a session that's antithetical to a lot of the training philosophy in this thread. For the marathon there is also fueling practice to consider, which is probably quite personal.

Because the study reported the largest ever increase in mitochondrial marker enzyme activities ever observed in a longitudinal study (minimizing genetic advantages), to match the two-fold higher values found in elite athletes, despite the fact that the participants only trained 4 h/wk. (Apparently you've never encountered the classic 1964 paper in *Science* on \"strong inference\", one major point of which is that scientific progress is most rapid when you focus on *disproving* hypotheses.) 3. No one has said that larger volumes aren't necessary/beneficial - it is just to the extent that they are, *it's not because of some unique ability of \"zone 2\" training to alter muscle respiratory capacity\" as you have claimed*. 4. *Of course* the results are partially because the individuals were initially untrained. But, that's the whole point, because that is the reference condition when evaluating the muscle respiratory capacity of highly trained individuals. 5. There are numerous studies in the literature of both rats and humans showing a high correlation between mitochondrial enzyme activities and performance, mostly dating back to the late 1960s to early 1980s. For rats, see studies from Holloszy's lab. For humans, see Sjodin's work with marathoners. *However, this is really just a red herring. You claimed (and continue to claim) that when it comes to mitochondria/metabolism, there is something special about lower intensity, \"zone 2\" training. As that classic study by Gollnick et al. so aptly demonstrates, there isn't. You therefore need to find another way of rationalizing your belief system with respect to optimal training, because your hypothesis about being about mitochondria is flat-out wrong * 6. There is no LT1 or LT2, or really even an LT - lactate increases continually albeit not linearly as a function of intensity. The way to shift that curve is obviously to train with some combination of intensity and vi, but science can't tell you what is optimal, especially for any given individual. More importantly, focusing on attempting to improve physiological responses/adaptations is a mistake. What you should focus upon is improving actual *performance*, and just let the physiology sort itself out. Otherwise, you will find yourself going down stupid rabbit holes, like doing \"over-unders\" to try to improve lactate clearance (which is irrelevant), or obsessively measuring lactate concentrations during almost every workout, in the mistaken belief that \"intensity control\" is critical to improvement.",

That's not a brag, it's just that even if someone came a long and said \"the science says you're an idiot\". I don't really care. FWIW I agree with Coggan in the sense that this training method is essentially sweetspot. I even said this sometime right near the start. I would also do more if I thought my body could handle it. But I don't think it can swing towards what I can handle on the bike. I still think 75/25 is the absolute most before you stray into injury territory. I don't think it's new in any real way, as Andrew will know it's a pretty common bang for buck approach for the UK time trial crew. A lot of what I picked up was originally shared by guys like Tarmacexpert on the TT forums, who I am sure Andrew is familiar with. Even old aged debates like 4x8mins versus 4x4, I've tried it all. This is just how I see the best risk free approach for cycling and running. I doubt I'll ever change or really mix it up. I think I've had half decent results for average talent in both sports. I just laid something out that I thought (I think has shown it does?) work for a large percentage of people who don't have a huge amount of time to train. That's not everyone by the way. There is no magic training etc . I also completely agree with AC on that. Is this the best way to train? ON 5-8 hours a week as runner? Maybe. Maybe not. If someone came along with another 100 page thread with even more success stories and someone who could show me the sustainability of being able to run day in, day out and not break down AND to get faster - I would just switch to that training system. Again, I really don't think there is anything magic about subthreshold or sweetspot, or literally whatever you want to call it. But I am as far away from a scientist or even someone who remotely understands what is going on under the hood. The spirit of this thread can be whatever people want it to be. For me, I just get up, go to work and do my own thing within the rough parameters I set out and hour a day and 90 mins on a Sunday. For others it's testing lactate. For others, the spirit of the thread might be just to try a slightly different training method to what a lot of running coaches might prescribe. To others, it might just be to strive to understand or get to the bottom of the science of it. The 30 min MP idea was kind of thrown around in the spirit of the thread, not to be taken seriously (when I posted it for instance) but then it might work. Who knows?

I actually got a bit worse at the back end of 2022 as i was needing days off and was actually being able to run less. Absolutely just hit a brick wall. Nothing I could do would improve me. Running just because a chore. Didn't really think much into it, other than \"why don't I just try and train how I used to on the bike?\" With some of the obvious adaptations to running. I used to dread the long run, the easy runs, everything. A lot of it was just too fast looking back, comical in fact. No wonder I was so tired. When I switched to this, almost instantly I could increase my minutes slowly week by week, absolutely straight away. The brick wall I hit was knocked down. I then started to improve after about 6-8 weeks of the new regime and it's been a pretty steady increase chipping away month my month since. I was pretty annoyed with myself that I didn't go with my gut and just train this way from day 1. I wouldn't say I love running now, but it's no problem to get out there. I'm never so tired I think \"wow I can't run today\" as often happened, especially after the really hard days Daniels sometimes prescribes. There's always something in the tank for the next day now. I'm never running on fumes. IMO a Daniel's plan, if you have 6-10 weeks to get fit for something is a fantastic way to roll the dice and it'll likely work out, not worrying about what comes after. Past that or longer term goals, I don't think it's sustainable in the way that I have trained. Again, I'm not saying this is the only way to train or even the best. But it's probably the most likely way to get most people the consistency they need with enough work on limited hours, without falling apart, especially say if you have a goal 6+ months out. Most of the thread is filled with the same range of comments, not a lot happened then progressively after a couple of months they started to really build into some good fitness, a lot they haven't seen before. I might have improved and found a way to adapt Daniels, but there is no way I would be sitting at 15:40/32:23 at 40 years old. This consistency has absolutely scraped every ounce of the average talent I have out. Much as it did on the bike. I was also way over achieving there for the average talent I had. But found a way to squeeze every last drop. But, as easy as it sounds, it's been a long, long grind and quite boring at times. The feedback I can give and the feedback so many others have told me, is that you can sustain this. No peaks, no ups and downs, just a slow burn in a pretty safe and manageable manner. The other thing, whilst injury's obviously still occur but the general feeling is this reduces the risk of injury to the lower end of the spectrum for runners.
