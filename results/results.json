It's very basic , usually: Easy Sub threshold Easy Sub threshold Easy Sub threshold Long run Repeat . I hired a lactate meter and turns out my paces are very similar to the equivalents he is running. That's a sample of two but for me who doesn't have unlimited money to spend on the test strips, it's good enough. I had stagnated around 18:5x for quite a while for a 5k (that's all I really run) but have now made quite a big jump recently to 17:27. Because there is very little vo2 max stuff I pretty much am ready to go for the next session no problem. Also feel way less tired running this way. In terms of overall training load (coming from a cycling background) it also creates more CTL for about the same amount of time on feet (around 6 hours 45 for me) compared to training more traditionally, which I had tried (I'd read Daniels, faster 5k and a couple of others).",

    "message": "Yes I used to cycle. I experimented training in a lot of different ways. What I found out (I used to time trial) is that whatever CTL I got to that I could maximally sustain, my power was the same over 10 or 25 miles (key distances for time Trialists). To pluck an arbitratory number at random , say my 20 min power was 340w at a CTL of 60, it didn't really matter HOW I got there. In the sense I could do that power on a range of 7 or 12 hours a week training. The 7 hours may have been sub threshold sweetspot every other day, or the 12 hours may have been lots of slow riding and some vo2 max stuff in a week. I tried 4-5 different ways to get to that CTL number. Each time my power was almost the same. Applying this to running, I have about 7 hours a week to train. So running as much sub threshold as I can, which gives a very good CTL score compared to say running 6 days, with long run, hills and a workout, means I'm creating more CTL for the same amount of time running the \"hobby jogger\" Norway model. This I think is the reason my times have improved, despite now not doing any proper REALLY hard stuff. I hope this makes sense? It's effectively a running version of what is very popular in cycling, \"sweetspot\" training. In terms of running just at LT pace, of course not. You adjust the pace depending on the length of the reps + rest. So for example 25x400 would be a faster pace, than the other end of the scale , 5x2k. But ultimately you are reaching the same state of sub threshold, just under. Remember threshold is a state, not a pace. That's why it's important to play around (if you can) with a lactate meter first, to get an idea and try to marry it up to the more traditional data you can get after each run. Ideally you would have a lactate meter all the time, but for hobby joggers like me, after a month or so you can probably get to 98% of where you need to be without it. For a pro, that 2% difference is a concern. But for me, I'm OK with that 😀",

They’re getting in under 5mi from the intervals and a little over 2mi from the warmup and cooldown, so it’s a 7mi session. That’s still a 14mi day, doing two of those a week would be 28mi, and doing 45min easy (5mi) on the other days of the week (or having one 5mi day with speed work) would bring the mileage up to 28mi + 25mi = 53mi. Could be good. Imo it would be reasonable to take 1-2 days off to bring the mileage down to 48mi or 43mi until the body gets used to processing those 14mi days. And then mileage can slowly build by having no off days, increasing some easy days beyond 45min, increasing warmup and cooldown, and simply getting faster so that more miles are done in the same amount of time.",

As Ive been using it a lot in training peaks. Im also coming around to the idea that you should push the threshold stuff as far as you can whilst keeping fresh.

    "message": "To the guy above: My CTL hovers around the 58-62 range. Although that number is kind of arbitratory in the sense it's only really relevant to me and how I've defined by pace , to set the training loads. If you do it by HR, it could be different etc. But as I said before, relative to me and how I collect data, I was about the same pbs for a while around the same CTL range. Which was about 50-52. That was on 6.5-7 hours a week. But now, training using the hobby jogger Norway method, I can reach that higher CTL, for the same time training. Everything I've played around with in both sports, suggests all CTL is created roughly equal. So in that sense, I could go back to running more of a classic running approach, ditch the Norway model , get a CTL of say 60 - and be around the same for 5k I am now. The problem being, it would take me more than 7 hours to get there. Maybe 9. I can't quite squeeze that in. So for the hobby jogger with a life outside of running, the Norwegian model probably gives you the best bang for your buck, even outside of doing doubles. Which I suspect is what Kristoffer, the oldest Ingebrigtsten brother, is doing. In terms of sessions. Again, it's pretty simple. 3 easy runs a week. All under 70% of max HR which is usually about 65% of MAS for those who work in paces as well. This will keep you definitely under LT1. Long run, I tend to just keep the same and by the end I'll be almost at the upper limit of that 70% which is the goal. I think the recent studies which was excellent, on the training characteristics of long distance elite runners (2022) had easy characterised as under 70% Max HR. That seems slow. It is slow. Very slow. The rest of the sessions are anything from 25x400 to 3x3k. 25x400 is probably around 98-99% of Tinman's CV. 10x1k is around 12-15k pace. 5x2k is around HM pace. 6x1600 right around 10 mile pace. I run everyday, so it's 3x easy, 1x long at the higher end of the easy boundary and 3x of the above sessions. The only fast stuff I do is are the parkruns. I've gradually improved after a huge stagnation last year and the summer before. Keep chipping time off my 5k pb each month and have for about the last 9 months now. It was around the same for ages. It's not a quick fix, but over time if you stick to it I think most people will improve and I also have felt fresher than I ever have. Also less niggles, I equate that to not doing the really hard and past paces anymore. I try to stick to that to be honest. It keeps it simple and mixes up what the body is running at. The key to this though, is all short rest. 60 seconds for everything but the 400s at 30. But having had the lactate meter for a while, it will all be around 2.5-3.5 mmol. Again, I no longer test. But I tested enough for a good month or so to know it's good enough for me. But I'm a 17 min guy. If I was Jacob, id care enough to do it every session. As I said before, I think I'm within the margin of error (as my paces I've specifically set on the safer side rather than pushing it.",

It's a shame power isn't a real option for running. The stryd is pretty laughable and the wrist based power on the Garmin is even worse. Until something better comes along, pace seemed to be the best metric that matched up with what the lactate meter was reading. Obviously if you live in the hills, this is gonna suck for you. But there's always the track. I'm lucky, I live by the sea and can do pan flat loops. So pace is very easy to stick to. I get what you mean about pushing it. I have a friend who is much more genetically gifted than me and started training like this and made some gains. But then he was sending me messages like \"felt good on the easy run so pushed it 15-20 seconds per /km faster\". Or \"was feeling so strong! So I did the 10x1k at 8-10k pace!\". This is where it starts to fall down. Obviously at the time it doesn't feel like much, but over time it adds up and you do that every other run and it's no longer sustainable. Then he's like I'm ruined, I can't handle this! Forgetting he was going way too hard. It works, because it creates what I think is the maximum training load, that minimises the risk of getting injured whilst still stimulating Threshold and vo2 max to an extent, by pushing it up from below. I definitely think it's a confidence thing. I think if you are coming from cycling or rowing , it's probably way easier to have the confidence to try this - as it's just not as alien. I think runners panic and see \"why are the easy runs so easy!!\" \"No vo2 max stuff?! What a joke!!\" Or similar. The icing on the cake for Jacob , that extra 2% I mentioned might be the hills. The stuff that pushes that lactate up above 8mmol and above. But for me, for the hobby jobber Kristoffer, just sticking to 3x easy, 3x threshold and a long run will get you very very close to your max potential, with relatively low injury risk and the extra bit of training load overall that will make the difference for your average, time crunched, hobby jogger.",

Say if you were doing doubles, you'd want to be pretty tight on the numbers being at or under sessions, but if you were only doing one a day three times a week, you might want to use the lactate to adjust intensity upwards more than you would in a double threshold model. Say creating some guide posts for yourself in a 10x1k workout at halfway: at your 5th K if you are over/under 3.0 mmol, to maintain or to speed up, meter dependent of course. Point being, if you in the singles camp, you really might went to press/chase the adaptations on a given day if youre feeling good by always trying to be \"on\" threshold rather than slightly under.",

    "message": "Ok, let's do a little rewind. The purpose of the \"Norwegian system\" is basically to maximize long-term fitness growth, which is some product of duration, intensity, and repeatability in training (over the course of weeks, months, years). While faster-paced, higher-intensity reps and workouts might produce more fitness growth on a per-mile basis, the \"Norwegian system\" basically prioritizes paces around LT because, when the intensity is properly controlled, an athlete can do \"a lot\" more of it in one day than higher intensities, and these paces are extremely unlikely to burn an athlete out, so they can do these sorts of days/sessions for the majority of the year, for many years. Notice that one of the keys to the LT work is to be able to do \"a lot\" of it! To institute it on lower mileage would really be a matter of figuring out how much LT work you could handle in a way that was very repeatable. Start small, control the intensity, and add volume incrementally. However, before you start (especially with double-thresholds), I would strongly recommend the following: 1. Be accustomed to doubling (even if you have to start with 2 x 20 min runs, get used to running twice a day on at least some days) 2. Be strong muscularly (weight/resistance training!) 3. Be as mechanically sound as is reasonably possible (drills, active stretching/activation work)",

It's not really about single or doubles. If you aren't doing enough miles to warrant it (im doing like 50-55) just do it in singles. If you are probably at the 70+ range I would start to think about doubling, but I would do the doubles on the easy days. So like 2x 45 min runs a couple of days. Then maybe (as I've seen Jacobs hobby jogger bro so), stick to 3 sub threshold sessions but add extra reps on. For instance I've seen him do 12x1k or he quite regularly does 4x3 k, whereas I'm doing 3x3k. This would take me up to maybe 65-70 miles and I'm still not in threshold double range, although a couple of easy runs. Doubles definitely help, I just don't have time. The most insane fitness I ever had on a bike was when I was riding doubles. I would do sweetspot on a bike twice a day on my commute and hour home and then same again back. I didn't know it really at the time, but I guess I was doing early Norwegian training almost by accident. I'm glad people find this useful. I'm not saying it's absolutely optimal. But for regular hobby joggers especially I think it's probably the maximum TSS you can squeeze into a week and it be sustainable.",

I'm certainly not the only one doing this - and nobody I've spoken to or seen as got slower. Even Jacob's older hobby jogger brother is still progressing. It's also worth noting what has already been mentioned, that just because most people train a different way, doesn't make what the masses do the best way. Going back to cycling, look at how British cycling or team sky looked at things totally differently after people had relatively training their aerobic systems the same way, for almost a hundred years. They then reinvented the wheel and everyone had to catch up. Obviously there were outliers who understood threshold training, use of power meters before, but they brought it to the masses. In my opinion we could be in the midst of something similar for running, due to the success of the Norwegians. This isn't a miracle. It's not suddenly turned me world class. But I do think it's the best way to eek out the maximum of my relatively limited talent. If you think, it's still not that different to a more classic approach. Before I was running 1 easy, 3 moderate runs, a vo2 max session and some sort of tempo along with the \"long\" run. Now I'm running 3 easy runs, 3 threshold and 1 long run. The key difference is the latter is slowly creating more stress, week after week on the body so you get fitter and fitter whilst feeling sustainable. It's just more work. Even though on the face of it it might not seem it. More work equals more gains. I really think it's that simple and for me makes total sense .",

These (I think as shirt boy posted) are probably near the top end of sub threshold. Most people who double will do these slightly easier perhaps but definitely the first session of the day would be more like marathon pace. But it you did 2 marathon paced workouts for example, that's still more TSS scored than one of these sessions I outlined. But I think I've heard people successfully targeting 1.5-2 in the morning mmol and maybe 3 mmol in the evening. Im more up around the 3.5 range in the single session. But if I was to double, I would probably do MP in the morning and then instead of say 12-15 k effort in the evening, make sure I was no faster than 15k in the evening. I hope that makes sense. You are basically doing the same paces I am now and for me it doesn't feel easy, but it also doesn't feel hard. The last one in the 10x1k I sometimes feel a bit. But I've dialled these all into paces that match up with my actual lactate responses when I've tested. So it may be slightly different for you. What I posted is just a guide. The one thing I would say, is if you are worried you are going to hard, dial it back a bit. It's most important not to go over. That's where even a few minutes a bit over threshold, you can really feel it the next day. Even at 90% of LT, studies have reported you are still getting 97% of the benefit. So I just don't see any reason to really push it and blow yourself up long term. I think if you can run what you are doing, run easy the next day + then go again the day after - keep doing what you are doing. It took me more than a month for a breakthrough, for what is worth. But then the gains kept coming in small drips. 5 seconds here and there off my 5k time and seems to have just kept going.",

The lactate is definitely more attainable these days and not super expensive. Rather than pay an online coach, a lactate meter and some strips with a general plan/guideline will probably take you 90% of where you want to go.

    "message": "Hi Lexel, I'm 39. I run every day. I've been doing this for maybe 9 months now I think. I missed a few days for a bout of COVID, but that's it. If you look at what the oldest hobby jogger does, who does singles - I believe he does all the paces also around what I have posted. The younger brothers, who all do way more miles and doubled, I believe ease of the pace a little more. I think for singles, you push it mostly to as close to threshold as you can safely, without risking going over. I'm going to go back to where I started with this - and talk about CTL. These aren't necessarily 'real' numbers, just using them as a guide as an example. For instance, if you were doubling you might run the 1ks in the evening and 5x6 in the morning. The 5x6 might give you a TSS of 65-70 at marathon pace and the 1ks at 95% CV around the same again. Whereas on singles, myself/ the older brother are running the 1ks around 12-15k pace (faster than 95% CV, and 95% is around HM pace for me) and for me this might create a TSS of 85. All these runs keep you below threshold , but the doubles are much safer, in that range where you might be getting 97% of the benefit for 90% of the effort. But over time, TSS and CTL wins. You'll obviously create a HUGE amount more doubling, even though you are running slightly easier. I believe, the singles brother and myself - have both decided or accidentally stumbled on the same idea that you want to be able to get every other day, but also want the most TSS. The doubles. I've ran slower but maybe created 140 tss a day rather than 80-85. What I'm also not doing and neither is the older brother, is the \"X\" factor session either. Or the hills. Or 10x300 I've heard Jacob do or anything like that. As I've tried to outline, I'm not trying to copy the professional Norwegian's. Just adapt it, to something manageable and sustainable any hobby jogger could do, if they have the discipline. I think others have point out as well as myself, the issue is most people will run this too fast. Once you do that a few times in a week, it's all over. The next session becomes too hard, or the recovery run isn't enough, then you suddenly find yourself in a hole halfway through the next session. One thing I've learned from cycling is going on feel is the most outdated concept. You won't see anyone racing or training on feel anymore be hugely successful. The power meter numbers, the training zones, it's all made people better riders based on the science. Running is quite a way behind in all of this, but this is a step in the right direct that there is even the interest on here to talk about it 😊",

I wish I had stuck to my guns initially, as my gut reaction to running was TSS was TSS, which creates CTL (to use the terms I'm familiar with from training peaks) which is what creates fitness. For the individual, you can create a training score and to within maybe 98% your fitness will be the same. As an extreme, I could probably achieve similar with running twice as much a week, but all easy pace with maybe one tempo run. But that would take double the amount of hours. But in terms of training load/CTL, would be the same. Id probably still be the same in a 5k. This is why you hear stories of guys running insane hours a week, mostly all easy (training for an ultra maybe) but then setting PBS all over the place in shorter distances. You can't compare other people's training loads, it's all individualised, as training score/CTL is just a number. But from what I know about myself in two sports + a lot of friends I have spoken to, that individuals score of say \"60\" (this is a random number) equates to roughly the same times for say a 5k-10k for that person.

It was only one rep of the 5 at the end, but I really did feel way more trashed agree and felt horrific the next day on the easy run.

I apologise but I just stalked you on Strava now I know who you are ha ha and I saw you ran 17.27 on a pretty slow course. I think you can go much faster? I went back and had a look, you really Jane improved hugely after being around the same level for a long time. The more textbook running approach clearly wasn't for you .I see guys you used to beat by a minute on the bike run sub 16 though?? What is your racing weight? How tall are you?",

The hills, the trackwork, and even the 400s are designed for primarily 1500m guys. If you are not looking to be needing a ton of speed 2k-3k repeats might be a better bread and better distance for your goals",

    "message": "Totally agree on the Friel stuff, i also liked the way he structured the # of hours you have in the week into how many days you should be training. Makes a lot of sense especially when you are debating between 30 minutes one day because youre trying to fit something in or just \"OFF\" With life as it is, im on the 6 day plan, 1 day off guaranteed. The planned off day is actually a lot more liberating psychologically than you'd think. Plus, it makes it so the other days you do structure can actually be more consistent since you aren't constantly pushing something a bit too taxing the day before you want to push the quality session. I'd say it's almost a sliding scale when the week starts based on recovery index. The week is generally planned to be: LT2, Z2, Easy, LT2, Z2, Easy/Z2 but if recovered and feeing good can be: LT2, Z2, LT2, Easy, LT2, Easy or if not recovering well: LT2, Z2, Easy, Z2, Easy, Z2 This is where i think the experience with yourself and a wearable is helpful. Whether it's using a wearable, using a lactate meter, whatever, you are just trying to manage and monitor stress appropriately. Same thing inside the sessions. Like Bakken's latest article mentions, he had sort of a 'Green, Red, Yellow' light system where he's chasing the adaptations on the good days, holding steady on the in between days, and backing down on the red days when you know life or stress is just not going in your favor.",

    "message": "This is great thread, thanks to everyone who added valuable input. Now regarding the statement I quoted above, I beg to differ: I have been dabbling with a lactate meter (Lactate Plus) for the past few months. In my personal experience, you definitely do much less than 20x400 w/30\" @ 10K pace and be well over 4.0 mmol/L. Context: I have run a 37:45 10K last April which is 3:46/km pace or 1:30.4 per 400m. I've been upping my mileage since that, now running my third week of 100 km (62 miles). I've been doing mostly one LT session to not over-stress my self too much since I was not used to this mileage. I have bumped it up to two sessions by last week. I introduced a 10x400m w/30\" rest last week as a second LT session. Given that the rest is very short, I only managed to take two lactate readings (After 4th and 10th reps). Here are my splits for the 400's: 1) 01:34.1 2) 01:29.4 3) 01:33.8 4) 01:29.1 = 4.8 mmol/L 5) 01:33.7 6) 01:31.7 7) 01:34.7 8) 01:30.8 9) 01:34.3 10) 01:32.1 = 4.9 mmol/L As you can see, all except one rep were slower than 10K pace, yet I was well above 4.0 mmol/L. Where is the catch? I have run my 10K race in a temperate climate, where-as my current training is taking place in brutally humid and hot conditions. This goes to say that lactate is dynamic and context dependent. A blanket, absolute statement such as the one quoted above is misleading. Now when I run similar pace on the treadmill it is a different story, even for 10 minute reps, I'm under 3 mmol/L for most of my reps, albeit them being a bit slower. (I have a Runn Optical Sensor which measures the true belt speed, so I trust the splits).",

    "message": "We have to make some assumptions here. Cant control for every possible variable, but yes, when you are talking about lactate it is somewhat dynamic. As to your particular workout, sweat contamination is one very real possibility. Heat and humidity will impact the # for sure. Not sure where youre taking the sample from, Lactate Plus needs a bigger volume of blood which many times gives the opportunity for more sweat contamination in the sample itself. Obviously the ear lobe is almost out of the question when doing it yourself, but if youre not really cleansing the site with at least some wet paper towel and then drying, you are going to get higher than normal readings if sweat is getting in the sample. It's always harder outside with unstable environmental variables. Also, that 10k time is from April. Not sure what your training has been on the top end since then. Less efficiency in the form of less strides/no speed work is certainly going to add to the stress this end of the 'threshold' scale is going to produce.",

    "message": "I would suggest trying :80 on/:40 off on the treadmill and just jump to the sides for the standing rest. Try that for 10 mph and see what your results are. That gives you a 2:1 ratio which is about right. Part of it might be pacing as well. And id say dont even bother testing before 8/10 reps. You are going to need to take a little longer break to get the test done adequately. If you were trying to do the 20, you are really doing a 2x10x400 workout with 1:00R/2:00R between sets for the lactate test. :60 seconds for a test can even be rushing it sometimes, especially if you are drenched. You can see at least the deviation is consistent. Sweat could produce a 1.0 mmol deviation here, seen it many times when the site isnt clean or you wind up touching your finger and not letting the tip just hit the blood sample itself, so its very possible you could be at around 4.0 at least for your workouts. With the Lactate Plus you might want to try taking the sample with your finger above the strip rather than the meter above your finger. Ive noticed that helping the results with that meter. The meter is also in a better position because its a little bulkier and sometimes is ackward coming at the sample from the strip down to the finger.",

The fact that both readings (from different fingers) are within 0.1 mmol/L of each other also suggests that they are likely correct readings. Obviously I would love them to be false, but I doubt that they were. As for how my training was for the 10K race back in April, I was doing a classic Daniels approach. Mileage was much lower than it is now though. I don't think I exceeded 80 km (50 mi) per week.

He didn't actually like the idea of threshold or sub at the time. Although I know he's flip flapped on that. But he said along the lines of if you do, you may as well go sub threshold and push it up from below as you are getting around 95+% benefit , with less than 24 hours recovery. I think most of his case studies are from cross country skiers though. It's probably all relevant to this conversation though despite being different sports, even though running is more impct based I don't know why the aerobic area would be any different, you just can't do as much work as cyclists or cross country skiers, which makes it even more baffling runners don't try and absolutely maximise their training loads as it's harder to pad out and fill a week than cyclists and skiers who can go on pretty much as long as they want without fear of inhury.",

He showed a graph of diminished returns. Basically within 90% of threshold you were aiding your recovery by more than 24 hours, but you were only missing out on a fraction of the training load that actual threshold would have gotten you. They spoke about it quite recently on a podcast I was listening to, it was the running public one I think. Might have been a Norwegian special one? Or the threshold episode. Can't actually remember. But it was this year. In terms of race preparation. At the professional level, no idea. I haven't really looked into what Jacob or any of those guys are doing. But his brother, well if you looked at his Strava nothing would tell you really he's doing a race, until, suddenly he's done a race. In the week of the buildup, he's just doing his sessions like normal . And then just keeps going again. This is what I've always done when I was cycling, never, ever did race preparation stuff. I'm the worst person to ask for this because even now I've been running, if I'm doing a 5k at the weekend, my week will still be totally normal.

    "message": "Yes, you are talking about pushing up your threshold from below. I'm mentioned this a few times I probably sound like a broken record, but this is something cyclists have known for a while now and with the advent of power meters it makes it insanely easy to train in that area, not go too hard and recover. Someone mentioned cross country skiers, applies to them as well and I've heard of speed skaters as well who have trained like this for a while. If you are a time crunched cyclist, if you aren't doing quite a bit of this training on your turbo trainer, you are behind the training curve. Good question about training distribution. Again, as I posted above Seiler orginally (20 years ago) said 80/20 was split into sessions. As I said before, you can never tell exactly where he stands but he's started to come around to the idea that for hobby joggers and cyclists, time in zone he would accept. Mainly because we aren't running doubles, so it's not realistic to have as much easy. I've looked at studies more recent, they usually include \"time in zone\" , although that is almost complicated in the sense it could be power on the bike, pace for runners or HR as the metric. Anyway, for me, on the bike I always just went on power. It's the easiest of all the metrics to collect meaningful data on. I was usually around always between 70/80 - 20/30 on the bike. This would be the same pretty much, no matter how many hours I did. For running, I've been going on pace. I live in a very flat area. So I can go on loops for 15k with like 10 meters of elevation on a road run. Again, if we are going in time on some, just having a look now, the last 6 weeks average out to 74/26. With the schedule I outlined above . This is polarised in the fact there is nothing aimed in the 3:58-4:57/km range other than what you might catch for a few seconds changing paces or whatever. But again, Seiler originally intended for sessions not zones (but has conceded a point as I mentioned) and a lot of the \"longer\" 2-3k reps are going to be also in the zones he would probably tell you not to run. But I like the idea of trying to fit 75/25 or 80/20 or roughly whatever you want, into just under LT1 and then in that just under LT2 threshold for the harder stuff, to push that up from below. This is a pure rough estimate that won't apply to everyone, but for me that's about anything 90-91% of LTHR up to 98% LTHR. So you have quite a wide margin of error. But if I'm somewhere in there, I'm seeing lactate numbers that are going to be giving me good stimulus for my \"20\" work , without wrecking me.",

But it's actually put forward in a really clear way, although may need to read through a second time. A lot of content here from quite a few posters. I do sometimes think about baseball when I think about stuff like this. Not saying it's made baseball better to actually watch it's robotic now, but how sabermetrics have helped improve players or scouting of players. The old scouts saying how this is how it's always been done, you think in 100 years we couldn't have worked out a better way? Discipline has been mentioned . I think you would have to change the mentality of groups of coached runners over time, because no doubt people will ruin these workouts quite quickly and go to hard. Which I guess means they aren't blowing THAT workout, but the next one, or the one after? If I'm understanding this right.",

    "message": "Yes that's the point. You aren't going to die or your legs fall off and or you'll never be a be able to run again if you go into super threshold, or beyond 😂 But you will start to cross that border where fatigue seems to accumulate fast, real fast, and then suddenly it's not easy to do an easy 10k the next day and then go again the following day with another session. I mentioned before, I had a friend do this. His claim was he was \"feeling great\" and pushed way past 12-15k that we had worked out for him should create the lactate response we wanted. He did this a few times back to back and then suddenly the week after , he's trashed. The whole principle is living on the edge, not falling off the edge of choosing to jump off the edge. Maximising training load, whilst maintaining something that can be recovered from, relatively quickly. It's why I really wish there was a good power solution for running. With cycling is very easy to just say I don't care how good you feel. This is the power zones for the workout, stick to it. It's why I posted the paces up that I work to, as for where I live and it being flat it's probably the best I've got without having to buy lactate strips week after week as they're expensive (although if I was a pro I obviously would).",

    "message": "This is a great thread indeed! I came to using a threshold focused structure through lots of experiment and, seemingly, sub-par race results when I would include intervals faster than about 10km pace. It was in 2017 when I started to use the following structure: Sun - AM: 60 min PM: 30 min Mon - AM: 60 min PM: 30 min Tue - Tempo Intervals (12*1K w/ 200m, 6*2K w/ 400m, 4*3K w/ 600m) Wed - 90 min Thu - Tempo Intervals (12*1K w/ 200m, 6*2K w/ 400m, 4*3K w/ 600m) Fri - 90 min Sat - 120-150 min (including 8-10 miles of tempo intervals) For a period leading up to a half marathon and marathon, I would include tempo intervals in the Saturday long run as well. Typically in the form of 15 min + 6*1600m (or 3*3200m) + 60 min + 4*1600m + 15 min. I basically pulled this from Daniels' T-L-T workouts. After the marathon I was focusing on a 10km race so began doing the long run easy and did the Tuesday tempo intervals on Monday. As has been mentioned already, I found the key to sustaining this was to keep the sessions controlled. I seemed to fall into a pace that was 0-5 seconds per km slower than my half marathon pace, so not true LT. This I think is key as if I tried to run my LT pace, I'd feel like I was reaching and would have not been able to sustain this structure. With the exception of the long run session, I'd finish the workouts feeling like I could have done more and gone faster. The few times I broke this weekly structure was the Tuesday workout, ten days before a Saturday (or Sunday) race. For the half marathon I did 4*4K w/ 400m, for the 10k I did a 10km time trial, and for the marathon I did a 18 mile tempo at marathon pace (I did this on the long run two weeks before the race). The result, for me, was a PR in all three races, which were spaced six weeks apart. The strength that you develop and ability to recover between workouts and from races was most notable to me! Also, I should add because I think it is important, my easy days were all very easy (i.e. no faster than 70% max HR, often under 65%). Hope that was informative and provides some further encouragement and insight!",

The boring and repetitious nature does give you one big advantage, it gives you data that you can actually track, workout to workout, and the actual confidence to know when and what you can likely perform. It’s not just following a schedule and hoping you get a specific benefit from this focus for a few weeks or from these one or two big workouts The Norwegians mind sound boring and arrogant, but they have the profile and numbers down to a science. They know what a champion looks like from a metabolic standpoint and from their previous data.

I think he's like high 19 low 20 for the 5k. I explained to him I was also on my normal run, I run that pace like 4 days a week. He genuinely was baffled and thought I was joking.

    "message": "This touches on two topics that resonate, keeping easy runs easy and burning out on intervals. I see a lot of training articles (not just from magazines but from physiologists and coaches) that define easy pace as 1:30 - 2:00 per mile slower than 5K race pace. To me, that's moderate and not a pace to be targeted as your normal easy pace if running regular sessions, say 2-3 per week. Research (and better still, accumulated experience) points to being able to run at a much lower intensity on easy days and still accrue all the benefits. If you're not doing regular sessions, I think you can run in this moderate pace range daily, but the fitness you'll reach will not be as high (specifically for racing) as if you are doing 2-3 threshold sessions and 3-4 easy runs per week. I really agree with your last point. Both personal experience and observed leave me perplexed as to why VO2 Max intervals are done in such high volume (and in some cases regularity) for \"amateur\" athletes when threshold work has shown it's both sustainable and delivers the athlete to near peak performance. Easy runs and regular threshold work (but not where you are regularly at and/or exceeding LT, call it 4 mmol but that can vary by individual) really do a fantastic job of getting you most of the way to your potential. As a personal anecdote, I was someone for who more than 2-3 VO2 Max interval sessions in as many weeks time would start to erode my fitness and more importantly, my performance. I briefly had a coach when I was in my early twenties who assigned me 2 VO2 Max sessions per week for a four week block leading into a 5km race. I started to feel like I was regressing in the third week and a week after the race, I was absolutely trashed. To the point I developed CNS fatigue and took 4-6 weeks of just rest and easy runs to get back to feeling normal. Also, like others on this thread have expressed and even in Marius Bakken's writings, there is what I consider an adaptive threshold where more threshold in a session or more in a week through greater regularity, will not result in any performance increase. I do think 2-3 per week with at least one easy day in between is the way to go.",

Where as keeping it just under LT allows for 2-3 sessions per week of 10km or more? I often wonder how much of this is due to mechanical versus bioenergetic impacts/stresses.

Coaches like Tinman, Rubio, Wetmore, Hudson us a pretty standard outline as follows: Sun - Easy w/ strides Mon - Workout Tue - Medium Long Run Wed - Easy w/ strides Thu - Workout Fri - Easy Sat - Long Run If that's a structure that appeals to you, you can use that template and just make both your workouts threshold sessions. If you're wanting to follow the \"Norwegian\" outline: Sun - Easy Mon - Tempo Tue - Easy Wed - Tempo Thu - Easy Fri- Repetitions Sat - Long Run If in your warm up for the two tempo sessions you do 8*100m strides, that's two sessions of strides there. The repetition workout is essentially a stride workout, so far as pace goes (assuming it is done at approximately 1500m pace) although if the repetitions are longer and/or the total volume is high, the physiological impact can be different than a basic leg speed session. I think a lot has to do with how you define these different training philosophies. For example, if you just think of the Norwegian System as emphasizing threshold workouts then whether you use the first template or the second, you're training using the Norwegian System. This is nothing new to be honest as runners have been using these outlines for years. I think what gives the Norwegian System it's novelty is 1) the regular utilization and analysis of lactate readings and using lactate values (or efforts) that are lower than the traditional LT as popularized by Daniels and others here in the US as 60 minute race pace or 4.0 mmol and 2) the redundancy in the workouts used. This even goes against some coaches suggestions on never repeating the same workout or always progressing the workout so as to modulate the training load. I personally think consistency over many weeks, say 18-24, and then just repeated for each build-up is better than the really intense workouts that are progressed toward at the end of most runners' training plans in order to illicit a big stimulus and \"peak\" them. Hope that was helpful and gives you some ideas.",

All are the same pace roughly. 65% of MAS (well current estimated based on my 5k time, but will get you within a few seconds per km of it). No strides. Nothing. The way I do it is so simple. The only thing I would/ might change is maybe add on 5 mins to the easy days and long run. The only rationale for this is there's a point where I saw Jacobs hobby jogger brother increase volume a bit, the odd extra rep here and there and he kept the overall rough 80/20 ish (more like 75/25) time in zone to the same ratio by then just making the easy days slightly longer. So it slowly moved him up to where I am now (just under 7 a week) to up to around 8 hours on average. For him, 10x1k has slowly become 12 etc. 5x2k has become usually 6. Shirtboy made a really good point. This is pretty boring. Pretty robotic. But it's by far the best jump in performance I've had after quite a while being around the high 18s. I really have changed nothing else, not weight, time training , literally nothing. Except the make up of the actual training load of the week.",

But the numbers are only relevant, to one's self. It's also worth noting it's flawed for cycling in the sense that Coggan will tell you that FTP is the power a rider can sustain, for 40km in a Time Trial.

    "message": "Looking at how Training Peaks calculates rTSS, it reduces to the following: (1/36)*S*(NGP/FTP)^2 where S is the duration of the run in seconds, NGP is pace adjusted for terrain and altitude, and FTP is one hour race pace (LT pace). I think some of these metrics and different ways of quantifying training are interesting but, I agree with lexel, they are just mathematical values to assign to what we as runners already know intuitively. Interestingly, I remembered reading a thread from years ago where Tinman posted the following: A 3 mile run at 25-30 seconds per mile slower than your 5km pace. A 6 mile run at 60-70 seconds per mile slower than your 5km race pace. A 12 mile run at 2-2:30 per mile slower than your 5km race pace. They are about equal in aerobic stimulus stress on your body, but the 12 mile run is more trauma, impact stress. If you have an LT pace of 6:00 per mile and compare what Tinman is saying (and what a lot of us know from training experience) to what the rTSS score suggests, running 54 minutes at 6:00 per mile would achieve the same score as running for 96 minutes at 8:00 per mile. That's insane! LOL",

For those who use the PMC it's incredibly useful, but I think someone mentioned, it doesn't really serve a purpose for anyone but yourself. It tells me more about my body than feel. I use Friels heart rate TSS, I don't personally find it far off. I train up to and for 10 mile races, as this is probably the limiting distance of TSS for runners. I can get close to 100 on that 10 mile race, roughly an hour. My easy runs are top end of zone 1 HR, to get to 100 TSS I'd have to run 2.5 hours. Id rather do the 10 miler, if fine that easier. So it's swings and roundabouts it can work both ways, as some of the outlier examples others have used. I think it gets complicated with those who are very aerobically trained for long distances. People are always arguing about the merits of TSS, CTL and the merits of the PMC. Maybe everyone is digging into the weeds a bit too much. In general, I think it must have some use when talking about this model, as in general it seems everyone who has improved in this thread, with or without knowing it would have increased their weekly TSS. So it must have some relevance to the discussion or pattern. I used to post a lot of trainer toad, Coggan argues there as well. He seems a bit of a douchebag? But one thing I agree with him on, people moan about outliers and NP buster sessions that give you 210 TSS for two hours. But his point is actually quite reasonable, why has nobody come up with anything better in 20 years? Anyway my two cents. Thanks to all the guys / gals posting here. This is probably the first letsrun thread I've ever read from start to finish , where nobody turned into a douche and where I think everyone can take something, no matter how little away from it as good for thought.

Its ok sirpoc if it works for you, but i had to mentioned that and i didn't want to attack you, far away from it. If an artificial intelligence would calculate such a stress value per week, how would it operate? Most likely it would define zones and provide some scale factors to it. The TRIMP or modified TRIMP system tries to do that. Polar uses Trimp since decades. It workes for me and i think it is better than TSS. What is debatable is, if it is better to do 30min at 95%FTP, or 45min at 90%FTP as an example. Only if you have different scale factors within those intensities you find a solution, otherwise the higher duration provides a higher stress, if the scale factor is the same in this range. Is it ok to have the same scale factor in this area, or should we use the lactate value and scale it??",

But 90% of FTP is probably doable 3x a week even for runners no problem, so overall it's going to create better fitness gains. I'm assuming this would be broken into chunks and not straight. Maybe a fairer comparison is if you say 100% of FTP and then 95. Then I don't even think it's a debate. I agree with guy above, basically I think this type of training going back to original discussion, works because simply Ur creating extra load in that sub T area you really pick the benefits up from. It's not hard to necessarily run or ride at FTP or what u want to call it. Ur just limited in how much you can do. 90-95%, not so much. Worse obviously as an isolated session, but over weeks and week u can simply do more.",

I've observed this in a lot of runners who don't run particularly substantive mileage and are more intensity based, when they add regular volume for 6-12 weeks and eliminate intervals, they set PR's in the 5km - half marathon distance that are a substantive improvement. I have normally thought of this as the classic case of being underdeveloped aerobically (think the examples from the HADD thread). In fact, going back to my remark regarding the rTSS scores. While it would be silly to suggest 54 minutes at LT is equivalent to 96 minutes at 67% of LT (as a 90 rTSS score suggests), you can flip it and say rather than killing yourself and doing 54 minutes at LT, you can run 96 minutes at a 1.33 multiple of LT and yield the same rTSS. Which in a sense is what you did when riding those 2.5 hours in Zone 2! As lexel pointed out, I think the debate has long been and continues to be what percent of LT can you do and still yield optimal/productive results for race performance. I personally find that somewhere between what is half marathon pace and marathon pace for me seems to be the \"sweet spot\" but I also try and do 45-60 minutes of that in a session (once I've built up to that of course). Usually I will start with 30 minutes per session, twice per week and build from there.",

As an anecdote, when Jack Daniels constructed his VDOT tables (a scientist named Jimmy Gilbert performed the mathematical modeling to generate the values) he had to work within certain constraints. One of which was “fitting” all runners on the same running economy curve in order to come up with the race time predictions at different distances. Part of the drawback is that you will have runners with above average and below average economy who over and under perform their predicted times (of course training and race conditions and other factors influence performance). The point being, training metrics which aim to quantify training stress or other values to standardize and predict come with a margin of error and are also dependent upon good data. I do think we are at a point where, with all the data our watches collect, we can build better models. It’s just a matter of procuring and filtering that data into new models. Still, that’s a lot of work and reliance on statistical methods which we know will not necessarily yield the level of nuanced output that we, as individuals with experience training, can often discern without such methodology.

    "message": "Going to be another long post. But I'm quite enjoying that there are actually other runners out there who maybe think outside the box and want to apply this sort of thing to hobby joggers like us lol First of all, it's remembering that TSS/ training load was originally done for power, as that is what Coggan was obsessed with. I didn't realise he still posts, but he is still to this day regularly posting on the \"time Trialling forum\", I linked him literally trolling the forum a few pages back . Like I said, he's a strange man. But I do still think there probably isn't anything better, I agree with the poster last night . I'm on UK time so I was fast asleep by then. This bit is specifically as a bit of an aside for those who maybe don't like TSS, CTL and the metrics. But if you go to those forums and search, there's a user \"Tarmac Expert\" who is probably the single greatest Time Trialist pound for pound, maybe ever. In the sense the times he did, on the absolute lack of talent he had, are unbelievable. Even into his 40s. His real name is Steve Irwin (everyone lol) but he's almost certainly a genius. He got (don't know if he's still riding) the absolute maximum out of what he had. To a point I've never seen before. Some technical, but from a physiological aspect, he was indexing his training against his CTL and then could index that to his fitness. It was very clear it was applicable (to him) I did the same and so on. Here's the thing , he HATED/HATES Coggan . So if anyone was going to hate on CTL, it was this guy. A standalone ride/run with a TSS score means absolutely nothing. But if you have years of data over time and you are sure that data is collected correcting (updating zones all the time) you will start to see patterns in the data you can use. Is it perfect? No. But again I don't think there is anything better. If Hard2find wants to try something better for running , I'd be interested! One side note, I just re evaluated all my runs (took a while, but had breakfast whilst it was doing it) from around the last 18 months. Changed TSS calculation from pace, to HR. This changed a lot of the individual runs in isolation, but overall the CTL Curve remained the same and showed a steady increase and it's around the same number as now. Obviously, that number means nothing to anyone but me. But whilst a few runs have changed their TSS value, it works both ways, some were TSS heavy in some areas via one method or the other, others the opposite. The point being it's not perfect, but over a long time it all evened out in the end. I can still plot along that graph, points where my fitness increased and marry that up to by PBs in the last year, with both calculations. Going back full circle, the question Lexel posed about which is better, 95% of FTP for 30 mins and 90% for 45 mins, I would say it's almost certainly the 45 min run/ride, the sport isn't important. There is still enough happening at 90% that is pushing up your lactate from below that there is at 95%. I also agree with what (I think it was the same guy added) is the better example is probably 90% or 100%. The 100% run as an absolute stand alone , single event, is obviously harder and for that one session you are getting probably a slightly better stimulus. But good luck doing that, every other day. You might be able to for a even a few weeks. But over a long time. Absolutely no chance. Whereas the whole point of this thread, is nobody doing this is running at 100% FTP/LTHR or however you want to put it, every other day. But quite a few people now as well as myself , that running at under that threshold but close to it, is doable 3 times a week and over a vast period of time, with almost no break or breakdown in the body or performance, in face the opposite, performance seems to be increasing. In pure simplistic terms, it's the systematic increase of load on the body in small drips from a tap, rather than turning on the tap full blast and trying to fill the cup in a short space of time, like a lot of other training plans. If I had 8 weeks to get fit, there's probably much better ways to do it. If I wanted a real long term goal in fitness that is measurable most weeks, this is definitely the most sensible way, IMO .",

I've never looked at heart rate during, as I do it on paced but this was married up to my lactate testing I did, which as a result I know will almost always keep my HR under threshold. But you could aim for between 153-163 (absolute max) for longer reps, say 5x2k. If you start out the reps and try and keep the pace the same and after the first one you are nearer 153-155 by the end, you probably will keep the whole lot under. I've not really tried to do this, but you could experiment. Just looking at my runs, my LTHR is 175, I'm usually in the mid to high 160s by the end of the first couple, and the low 170s by the end of the 5th. Definitely don't start out too hard, what you don't want to do is go too far over your LTHR. It defeats the purpose. I posted way back on another page, but I purposely once went over by upping the pace in the last rep, spent almost 6 mins which doesn't seem like a lot, but I was trashed the next day compared to what I usually am. I couldn't have done that 3 times that week. So it's a fine balancing act, very controlled, very measured, as others have said, very boring. Side note: you just wouldn't be able to control anything under 1km by heart rate. I've never tried but I don't see how you could really. Someone might be able to correct me on that.

Takes a while to dial a pace in that you can do the entire session and not exceed the ceiling, but when you do you pretty much do not even need the lactate readings anymore and you can completely know by HR. This of course means your workout cannot start hot. That HR will drift slightly during the session.

    "message": "I went on to Training Peaks and did as you said, I looked into the metrics they use and how they apply it. I was previously unaware of it before reading this thread (although I am familiar with Joe Friel's training, as a side note). I think any one who makes the effort to quantify training and present it in an actionable and understandable way for athletes in their pursuit of performance improvement is undeserving of harsh criticism in regard to the derivation of the metrics they use, as ANY modeling is going to come with compromises and incompleteness, to a degree, so I don't want to at all give the impression I thought or think these metrics useless. The ATL and CTL are both weighted moving average models, which basically is just saying it gives more emphasis to your more recent runs than runs in the past but that runs in the past do contribute to your overall fitness, but at a diminishing fraction the further in the past they were performed. Both the ATL and CTL are derived from the TSS score though. This, to me, is where the nuance and personal interest comes in. Specifically how you can achieve the same score with a totally different training intensity distribution. Conventional theory would suggest you need to do race specific workouts to run your best times but based on this model you could, in theory, reach similar metrics without such workouts and just emphasizing volume. It sounds like what you said you did with the 2.5 hour rides in Zone 2 spiroc, before riding a 10 mile TT PR. Personally, what I wanted to do, and to some degree but with less enthusiasm than a decade earlier (LOL), still want to do, is design a system that works to bring a runner to their, what I would call \"adaptive threshold\" given time constraints for training but also measuring adaptive response to specific workouts. As I've stated before though, I think that if you're a thoughtful and observant individual and are disciplined in your training, you can largely discern this without the, perhaps, overly complicated quantitative analysis.",

Intervals icu uses \"fitness\" as CTL is trademarked, but it calculates it the same. You can record TSS in order of priority, power, pace, HR, or any metric of the 3 or order them in any priority you want. There was a great thread I've been looking for where \"tarmac expert\" the guy I mentioned before, on the time Trialling forum, indexed his CTL to knowing what his power output would be, no matter really how he got there. It was even closer than mine. When I realised this after a few years of cycling, I was just doing less and less training to get my CTL number as high as I could. It worked. The interesting thing about when I was injured and had a broken collarbone as well as shoulder blade, was I wasn't even trying to do anything. I was just bored for 6 weeks and watched a couple of movies a day in front of the TV and rode the bike everyday in the hope I wouldn't be horrible when I could finally go outside again. Bradley Wiggins whilst a quote controversial character, was also a big fan of looking at TSS per session and CTL. Lexel mentioned TRIMPS, which you can also use on golden cheetah, but ultimately again what we are all talking about is roughly the same, is we are measuring or trying to explain why this works. Ultimately, whatever metrics you use, the takeaway seems to be doing 3 sub threshold sessions a week is probably creating a greater load than anything else you can do and maintain, over a long period of time. For me, it's around 115-120 minutes a week at just under threshold. Without feeling trashed. You are in this for the long term, not a 6-8 week block.",

Of course your idea is not a bad one, slower is better with these than going to fast. But now days here in Netherlands you can even rent a lactate meter for month for like 100 euros. I think that's a good solution and not much investment if u are serious a about this like the English spoc did. Because it can be quite individual .

You wouldn't be able to do 3 true threshold runs a week, even 1 + a vo2 max session is asking a lot. But these take less out of you, but you need to know you are running in the right area. Let's say the 18:07 is your most recent, you are running you 400s a little faster than I would, as you are right bang on about CV. If you've run that 36:39 and that's more like your most recent fitness, then for you it might just require a slower % than me of CV for the 400s (which for me let's say 98% of CV). You are likely going to fast I would say and probably at least the last 5-6 reps are pretty rough? I'm just guessing as that's all we can do without measuring lactate. Perhaps try 10x1k or a couple less if appropriate to your mileage. But run them around 6:15-20 per mile. See how that feels. This is where once you get going with this, as a few others have said it becomes easier as you can adjust based on the repeatability of your workouts. The racing helps as well so you actually know where you are at, not guesswork, or what you might have done a year ago (not saying that's necessarily the case for you).",

I'm not saying it should feel easy, it should almost feel like you do at the end of a tempo run. It bites a touch near the end, but ultimately it's not too bad and you could do it again in another 48 hours. If you feel like you could only do it once a week, it's definitely too hard. But as I've said before, I purposely have gone too hard, not by even much , just to see what would happen and the recovery and feeling of fatigue was drastically , I really do mean drastically, increased. So this is a high wire act. You really do need a good solid data points to even start to make this work. Someone suggested renting a lactate meter, this is a great idea IMO.

Spoc and shirtboy clearly have stated that, who have made excellent points in this thread. They gave paces that they did, they made it relevant to their lactate they were looking for. Nobody can say the exact paces without lactate. The paces lexel mentioned are what Norwegian system says to do them in doubles, 2 double sessions for week + hills. Spoc, Kristoffer the hobby brother to Jacob, they are pushing a little harder as it's only one session a day, to really get to limit to lactate to be able to do a single session again 48 hours later. It's just doing the most you can handle, without crushing yourself. Doubles, you can't handle 2 X Close to 3.5 mmol , so you do first session definitely under, like Lexel says they do, maybe 2 mmol, then they push a bit more on the second maybe just above 3. Overall more stimulus by far than one hobby jogger session. But hobby jogger goal is to fill that one session maybe even above 3, but not bust and can still carry on later in the week. It makes sense I think if you read thread start to finish. Spoc and hobby jogger brother of Jacob can clearly handle it as both push in the paces spoc post maybe right near the start. Neither is bust yet after a long time and both improve. Sorry for bad English.",

    "message": "I'll say to the people who don't believe in threshold, the cynics and the skeptics, I'm sorry for you. I’m sorry that you can't dream big. I'm sorry you don't believe in miracles. Joking aside, I think we know we’re ultimately an experiment of one. For me, I started on the “classic” 1 long run, 1 tempo run, 1 interval, and 3-4 easy runs template. This worked of course as I was starting out, but I plateaued. I tried adding more volume but always found the interval session seemed to beat me up and zap my stamina. I have tried higher mileage and two interval sessions a week, lower mileage and two interval sessions a week, higher and lower mileage with just one interval session a week… all permutations lead to, what I felt were, below optimal results. This, along with curiosity and a desire to optimize my time spent training, lead me to adopt a 2-3 tempo sessions per week approach. I have really detailed data on all my training and checked this so that I’m not just idealizing what I did. The first time I used this approach, in 2017, for a 24 week period, I averaged 10.5 hours per week of running, with a high of 12 hours and a low of 7.5 hours. As a side note, this was and is my highest ever, I since have stopped running doubles and aim for 9-10 hours in singles for 7 days or 8-9 hours if running 6 days per week. During that time I ran 2-3 tempo sessions per week (if I did 3, I included it in the long run for that week). The sessions were very basic and consistent, 12*1km w/ 200m, 6*2km w/ 400m, 4*3km w/ 600m, 3*4km w/ 800m. My HR_Max is 195 (tested, not guessed) so it’s pretty easy to know where I am as a 5% change is almost exactly 10 bpm. On those workouts, my HR never exceeded 90% HR_Max and basically stayed in the range of 80%-85% HR_Max. Part of this, I believe, was due to the volume I was running, as well as the fact these were in interval form. I find that if I can get to running 75-90 minutes average per day run, this gets me to the same fitness as if I average more, say 90-105 minutes, which I was doing during that time for some weeks. On 60 minutes average per day run, I know I have a little more fitness to squeeze out of myself, but I’m not far off from my best on that volume, particularly at 5km. For some performance specifics, I ran a 10km time trial as fast as I ran a 10km race a year earlier and did it at 88% of HR_Max! When I ran the 10km race I ran a PR and did it at 94% of HR_Max (about 10 days after running the time trial). I also have other data, from testing, that shows even when I maintain volume if I start doing VO2 Max intervals, after just a few weeks, my performance declines. Also, if I drop the volume of my threshold sessions to 30 minutes, twice per week, at LT (instead of a little slower) my fitness is not as high as when I did 48 minutes at slightly slower than LT. I know most aren’t likely interested in this level of minutia but as others have said, trying to get the most out of our training given time constraints and other obligations is the goal for us amateurs. Knowing we are doing that, at least for me, is a satisfying feeling and makes the training all the more fulfilling. Plus as others have said, the sustainability of it is most satisfying and impressive. Yes, you’re tired, but never trashed if you keep disciplined pacing.",

An example would be: 3-4*3200m @ 90-95% LT + 30-60 min + 2-4*1600m @ 90-95%LT I ran a half, marathon, half, and 10km race, all 6 weeks apart, all PR’s, and all in line with predicted performance. I actually used a 5*2400m @ 70%-75%-80%-85%-90% HR_Max as a standard workout leading into the races to have for comparison and as an easy workout before the race. The 4 easy days were all VERY EASY. In terms of HR percent I did them no faster than 70% HR_Max. I felt I had go that easy in order to run the workouts consistently. With the strength I built from the volume and threshold work, I found I ran my best races with a minimal taper (3-5 days). When I start to cut volume, both easy and threshold running, I find my fitness quickly declines, especially for 10km-marathon. Hope that’s helpful.",

Now I've ran my first 10k and was super strong the whole way, I'm actually going to enter a ten miler. I'm not going to change my training one bit. Not a half marathon, but even if it was I probably wouldn't change anything other than just making all the easy runs an hour, maybe extending the long run 5-10 mins and making 3x3k 4x3k, purely out of interest to see what happens. Unbelief understands this type of training very well himself anyway, so I would just follow that as he actually knows what he's doing at the distance rather than my guesswork. But I can now safely say this works fantastically well for me for 5 and 10k 😊",

My experience is that with the half you should be able to run in line with your 10k time given what you're doing. I found that running 7.5 hours per week, with 3 threshold efforts, like 3*10 minutes, 3 easy 60 minute runs, and 1 90 min easy/moderate run got me almost as close to my best as when I was running 10.5 hours per week. Based on my data, it was a 2% improvement that I saw in the half with the higher volume mileage and threshold. So, basically a 40% increase in overall weekly volume and a 50% increase in threshold volume per session, lead to only a 2% increase in race performance at the 10km and half LOL.

Maybe vVO2 is closer to 8 minutes, maybe vCV is closer to 35, for example but the pace you could hold for those few minutes shorter or longer is not as varied as the pace people run when someone associates LT to your half marathon pace or CV to your 10K. I agree there is too much variety in blood lactate readings to suggest singular figures to train at. I think most people who engage in these topics understand, as with most any data collection, there's going to be a distribution about a mean. I also think we sometimes go too far in the weeds about trying to illicit detail or reinvent how training is done. Jake Wightman beat Jakob Ingebrigsten at last years 1500m and no one, as far as I've observed, is asking how he trains LOL It seems that while physiologists and some of us give thought to the mechanism behind improvement and quantifying it, plenty of coaches and runners are fulfilling their potential with good old trial and error. And to be fair, we really are pretty much all in the same neighborhood of what we are doing.",

Great thread guys. I think finally people are understanding the true mentality behind “Norwegian” training. I once heard Jakob say on a podcast (some non running Norwegian company podcast or something) - his goal is to run as many miles as he can, as fast as he can. And he can’t run fast every day because he will get injured. The goal is essentially to do the most training you can sustain. Id be curious how spoc will progress his training. Kristoffer has very gradually increased volume over time - almost imperceptibly but over years it leads to big changes. One other thing to note- KI was doing some shorter and quicker reps over this past winter, and 1k reps around 3:20. He sustained it but eventually posted that he felt beat up so slowed down a bit and increased the volume. So even Henrik is experimenting with what might work…and tracking it.",

    "message": "Sustained training, that is the point that we've been emphasizing. Well put! A back of the envelope calculation, but really as much a conceptual idea as metric, could involve using your HR. No, as with any metric, I don't think this is infallible nor precise. Having said that, I think we would all agree that if we ran all our minutes per week at 75% HR_Max, we could sustain that, right? Well if you simply use 75% and multiply that by the total minutes run, you can use that value to track your training, similar to TSS and CTL. For example, if you run 7.5 hours per week, 450*0.75 = 337.5. If you wanted to standardize this just divide by the total number of minutes ran, which in this case will just give you 0.75 since there was only one input. However, using this as a benchmark, you can include different intensities. For example: 90 minutes at 85% HR_Max 180 minutes at 75% HR_Max 180 minutes at 70% HR_Max 90*0.85 + 180*0.75 + 180*0.70 = 76.5 + 135 + 126 = 337.5 337.5/450 = 0.75 So, same total and standardized to 0.75 but with 90 minutes spent at 85% HR_Max, which roughly for most of us probably works out to running between MP and HMP on long intervals. And again, before I get attacked for the pitfalls with this like, what if you run a pace faster than the minimum pace that illicits HR_Max, don't you know HR can vary based on heat, fitness, nutrition, hydration, etc. It's simply a potential way to gauge YOUR training, as the total score and standardized value can vary based on your personal training volume and findings. Of course, I wouldn't suggest it's going to tell you anything you don't already know intuitively.",

I figure with him being a British middle distance guy and from what he was saying about training, his template is more from the Horwill and Coe approach to training than Ingebrigsten. I agree with you as well on the lactate reading, but I do wonder for amateurs or lets say runners not running substantive volume, how they would perform. When I used the meter, I was running 9.5 hours per week in singles, which I would consider substantive. In fact, one summer I even did all my workouts on a treadmill for 12 weeks. Just the two workouts per week, all other runs were outside. I did regular testing and found that 3.0-3.5 mmol was my range for most of these. In order to get to 4.0 I had to put out an effort that felt more like 10km race effort. I often found that once my volume was up and I was doing 40-50 minutes of threshold intervals in a session, the accumulated fatigue made me not even want to try and run any faster than those readings anyway LOL. I found that when I dropped volume a bit to 8 hours per week and dropped the threshold to 3*10 minutes at what was a more intense effort, I got to 3.5-4.0 mmol but lost fitness in my 5*2400m test and a time trial test, which was interesting, to a degree.

Lexel, I think maybe you add digging in ground too much. I don't want to cause tension that is not my goal but CV has its flaws, I think your thinking is wanting to have a running metric that works just as well as power. Once we have that all these debates be finished. One thing I learn from cycling now, training so much easier to measure and control. PMC is easy to use and understand over time and I agree you can use the metrics to give an idea where you are. It is not perfect. But now I'm just hobby cyclist over runner he he oh sipoc I would happily pay for your services to set up my position for time trial bike, I hear you are cda field testing master. But that is for another time 😊 Hard2find I think in simplistic terms, you are probably along the correct lines with your HR talk. I think it's better than nothing hrTSS works OK. But nothing comes close to power. But that does not mean a user cannot find patterns to index in their own data in the PMC for running. But it's less compatible to others. Although the sessions like spoc and others laid out I think are still maximum way a runner who is just hobby guy will max his potential closely W And yes, in cyclist terms this is time crunched training they say. I mean, you cannot get injured cycling so it's really just for the lazy guys like me . But has a hobby jogger runner, you have to realise life outside exist and strain on the body is a lot. Maybe I should have done this when serious runner, as I got injured to much. Pushed envelope too far and cracked.

In that year I've come down to a 17:27 and yesterday a 35:50 , so I think I might be able to dip under 17 soon, especially as the 5k course I do has 3 dead turns (only 5k I've ever fan, but done it like 25 times, which also helps at plotting progress). It's little gains, here and there. There was no big leap apart from the first PB. I had been doing this maybe about 6 weeks and nothing seemed to happen. Then suddenly I pb'd by like 25 seconds out of nowhere. I guess that was my body adapting and then the door opened. I think I mentioned before, if I increase volume I will do it incrementally and proportionally to my 75/25 easy /sub threshold load. So it might be I add on 5 mins to all my easy runs and then that adds on maybe an extra rep somewhere to my sub threshold intervals, in it's most simplistic form. What holds me back I'd time. This week I was at 6 hours 45, maybe I could stretch the whole week to 8, but with life etc that's likely my limit. But that still gives a bit of time to play around with.

    "message": "I assumed that most of us engaging in this discussion do have an appreciation for the nuance of these metrics, LT included. The two tests I see most often used and cited (but not saying these are the only and best ones) are either 1200m intervals on the track or 3 minute intervals on the treadmill. I’ve used both myself, but have also collected readings when doing tempo intervals, VO2 Max intervals, and 60-90 second hill repeats. I may have also poked myself after a few time trials, I’d have to check my data. All of that is to say, I was aware that what I was gathering was unique to me (just as spiroc stated about TSS and CTL values) and not necessarily generalizable to others without standardizing it. I’ve seen it discussed before that if the intensity was increased in smaller steps, the lactate curve would likely be a continuous exponential function that could be fitted for each athlete specifically of course. I think the same would hold true that if you extended each interval in duration, past a certain intensity level, the lactate readings would rise if you went long enough. This to me, is why standardizing is helpful, as it gives a consistent way to report data and then extrapolate for others to use and experiment with. I think we appreciate that most running metrics are multi-variate, so far as what is contributing to the output being achieved. I’d suggest that blood lactate isn’t only intensity and time dependent but also physiological in the sense of the athletes fiber make up. Meaning, I can’t seem to generate high values of lactate, relatively speaking. I’m VERY, seemingly, slow twitch dominant as well and from the data I’ve seen, this seems to perhaps be a characteristic of runners like myself. As opposed to the ones who are more middle distance oriented and can generate higher relative lactate values. Similar to heart rate, I thought of the lactate readings as 1) a source for some new data and 2) a different way to control effort and, perhaps, quantitatively know I wasn’t overdoing it in workouts. Having been there, done that. I think it’s helpful, but certainly not something that’s going to turn me into a world beater, as that’s not seemingly in my genetics. However, like everyone, I do have a maximum potential, so it’s interesting to try different approaches in the quest to reach that point and feel like I'm pursuing that purposefully and productively.",

    "message": "Anecdotally and to the point about blood lactate varying with intensity, but also duration at that intensity. It’s very similar for HR. I found when doing 1K-4K intervals for a total volume of 12K, my average HR on these intervals was near the HR I averaged in the marathon. However, my pace on these intervals was usually at or slightly slower than half marathon pace. I of course knew that when racing, the fact that it is continuous and a distance greater than the workout volume, my pace to HR was not going to match what I was doing in my workouts. In fact, I did a 18 mile tempo run at nearly the same pace I averaged for the marathon at an average HR of 155 bpm (80% HR_Max), in the marathon I averaged 163 bpm (84% HR_Max). Maybe I shouldn’t have tapered at all for that race? LOL. For reference, when I ran the half marathons, my HR averaged 91% Max_HR. I never approached this effort in my tempo interval sessions though (for the average of the interval). I was running high volume during this time, 10.5-11.5 hours per week most weeks and do feel the higher general volume contributes to the HR values staying lower. When I’m not running as much volume, say around 7.5-8.0 hours per week, my heart rate on tempo interval sessions will rise higher to about 90% HR_Max. I think this is pretty established though that the fitter you are aerobically, the harder it is to approach that higher HR in sessions, since it requires a more intense pace if the duration is not sufficiently long enough. Conversely, in a race, you can hold a higher percent of HR_Max since you are more aerobically fit.",

    "message": "Hi Lexel, these are paces that keep my sub threshold state. So these were all tested with a lactate meter. The paces are kind of irrelevant, they just are to give an idea of what speeds I run for me, to keep my mmol in the desired range at a maximum of just below threshold or even a little under that. I just call it sub threshold in the sense it is pushing up my lactate from below, much like the success I had whilst cycling. I mean the best tool would be a real time lactate meter, I hear that actually one of Tadej Pogacar's coaches is very close to a prototype. The paces are all different of course, but with different lengths with the rests, when I spent a month or so testing them, they all got me to around about the same range of lactate. Plus it's nice to have some practises at different velocities and speeds. The training is boring enough as it is. But I would guess you could just stick to one set, if you really wanted to. Maybe Kristoffer is training for something longer again, as he much favours heavily the 3k repeats. Now I have new data and the fact I've gotten fitter based on a quicker 10k, relative to my 5k, I'll adjust my actual paces to back within the parameters I set. As this thread is still quite active I have a lactate meter I can borrow again and I'll buy some test strips and see. So I'll raise the actual pace for say 1k, but leave it relative to my 15 k pace and I *should* see the same sort of lactate levels, within the margins of error that is good enough for me.",

    "message": "We ultimately train to race, so our race performance is the ultimate predictor of, well, our race performance LOL. I get what Lexel is saying in regard to having a standard pace that is then reported as a percentage of when structuring workouts. I think that has seemingly been what many tried to do with LT (defined as 60 minute race pace). I know Tinman has his reasons both bioenergetic and statistical that he thinks CV is better than LT (perhaps some of those are promotional too though), but depending on your physiological make up and race distance you’re training for, CV could be far off from your race pace say if you run the marathon as opposed to if you are racing 5km to 10km. So if you used LT (60 minute race pace) that would be closer to half marathon and marathon race pace and thus would likely come with a narrower window of predictive error. Point being, in either scenario, it’s an arbitrary lab value. As I’ve said before, we don’t seem to have a true understanding of the mechanism that underlines the variety of adaptions we see to a variety of athletes using a variety of training philosophies. No one seems to be able to know that CV is a good predictor of 5km performance simply because it is closer as a percentage, and thus physiological demand, to 5km race pace any more than because it holds some deeper physiological influence. We know the further up in distance you go, say from 5km to the marathon, the more overall volume contributes. Yes you can run good predictor workouts and have good lab metrics but that’s a lot different than running an actual race. I know from personal experience that I can run my 5 km best off about 7.5 hours per week (and possibly my 10km best too). But I fall off slightly for half and even more for full. If I reach 9.5 in singles, that’s basically me at my best for the half and full (correlates to what Lydiard suggested too btw). However, of interest, is that I’m no faster over 5km with that added volume and only marginally better at 10km, to the point it could just be some random factor on the day of the races/tests I’ve done. I think of this as an “adaptive threshold”. Whether it’s my body being able to only absorb so much or physically just not being able to run any faster than a certain percentage of say my 400m speed, is a curious discussion, but the reality of my performance doesn’t change. Not to belabor this point, but Daniels has said on various occasions that there is no physiological difference in training at marathon pace than at your easy pace, seemingly implying that you should stick to what he defines as T pace if you want to improve your LT. However, if I try to run Daniels T pace spot on, I always feel like I’m overreaching and can only handle one of those workouts a week and no more than 10km volume. However, if I slow down by just 4-8 seconds per 1600m, I can do 12km in volume, twice per week, and see race performance improvements relative to previous races where I did follow a Daniels approach. I also notice I always seem to over perform what my workouts would “predict”. I’m always slower in workouts than what race performances and calculators say I should be.",

Im sure we all have stories from our past where our ego completely ran the show. Called being young mostly. To the Daniels point, i couldnt disagree with that more. Marathon pace for runners is essentially Zone 2/LT1 work. I think at this point there is a mountain of evidence that show very distinct adaptations and advantages to running in Zone 2 vs running Easy. Take two runners for instance in a summer build up to fall XC. One runner does only E runs according to Daniels and strides. Another runner does a variation with 3-4 days a week with higher Aerobic/Zone 2/LT1 work. Im putting my money on the Zone 2 runner to really be able to springboard into the harder work and racing in the fall I'd say this system works great when fueling and fat burning are not a higher consideration, basically 1500-HM (depending on how long you are on your feet for the HM). WHen you are talking full Marathon, you really need to think about the demands of that event, and the other considerations and adaptations youll need for 2:20-4:00 of work. There you definitely need the longer runs and you definitely need the LT1/Zone2 work to juice your fat burning capacity and spare as much glycogen as possible for as long as you possibly can to not bonk. In the Half, depending on how long it takes, same considerations. You really have to think about the limiting factors in the event. Like people keep popping in with previously \"oh you need VO2 work\". Id guess 98% of people running 5k-HM, their VO2 Max is not their biggest limiting factor to running faster, which is the goal here as you have stated. Not just putting up huge training numbers or physiological stats, but speed over a given distance.",

Let's take the 2ks as I do a lot of them. The fastest I tend to do is them is around at 3:49 and that is only under 8 minutes of work at a time. Even then at the end I'm right at around my threshold state, by the end of my last rep. I can't imagine being able to work at things like 2x15 like he prescribes at his T pace? I think from memory he has things like this as his sessions. I have his book somewhere. I could maybe throw throw that in once a week at that pace , but it would be pretty hard and hit me the next day. I know it doesn't sound like much more, but it really does mount up fast the recovery once you tip over that threshold. I kind of get what Lexel is saying as well. Don't get me wrong, I would love something standardized. But I don't need to know what my CV.

    "message": "I feel like what this thread is really uncovering is getting to the bottom of what training really is. We should all be individualizing more. There are certain shortcuts or benchmarks people use as a guide for how to train which are really quite false and bad but are very common: 1.) Using a race performance to modify training. It should be done in certain ways but not in other ways. Where this goes wrong is when the race performance is good and people use this as a reason to modify their training. Isn't that just crazy? Good races are often used as justification to increase training intensity or volume, like \"I need to update my training paces according to this new performance\" or \"I have achieved all the improvement I can get out of this training volume and now I need to increase it if I want to continue to improve.\" Both ideas are insane! But they are so common. If you have a good race, that is an indication that your training is effective as it is! Don't change it! It's only when you have a bad race that you might say \"I'm overtraining\" or if you have plateaued then you might say \"I'm undertraining.\" If you have a good race, your training is effective, don't significantly change it! Run the same volume at the same perceived effort. Paces and mileage will naturally increase without conscious effort. Keep doing that until improvements stop coming, and only then do you intervene. 2.) Comparing your training to someone else's. This is also crazy, especially when you tie it in to comparing your races and your training to someone else's races and training. Our ability to train is way too individualized, just like our ability to race. One untrained person can run a 17:00 5k while another runs a 23:00 5k. One untrained person can do training load X while another untrained person can do training load 2*X. It can really vary by that much such that it's not even close. And the two things (our natural ability to race and our natural ability to train) aren't related. The 17:00 5k runner might be that much faster in the 5k but they cannot handle anywhere near as big a training load as a slower 5k runner. In fact I'd guess that they're probably inversely related: the faster you can run with less training, the lighter your training should be and the more cautious you should be about increasing it. 3a.) Key workouts. People do \"indicator workouts\" or \"race simulator workouts\" which are totally unnecessary and completely break the optimization of training (in the sense that the amount of time they take to recover from is not worth the benefit they're providing). RACES are the thing which we try our hardest in and break the optimization of training to do. If you want to do hard efforts, then do a race! Don't race in training! People need to have confidence that their training is effective. Jakob has talked about this -- he doesn't need to prove anything to himself in a workout. He's 100% sure that the training he's doing is effective. His hardest efforts are reserved for races, where they matter. All the rest of his effort is used for optimal training, which doesn't involve maximum efforts. 3b.) Peak weeks and \"down weeks\". This is so high risk and is there really a reward? You're essentially overtraining on purpose. What if you don't fully recover? Your race performance will be ruined. What if you would've gained more fitness by just having two normal weeks? Marathoners will increase and increase their mileage and then have a huge marathon pace long run \"on tired legs\" for the peak of their training. Maybe, MAYBE, designing your training cycle with this kind of thing is optimal. But SO many people mess it up and it is absolutely not necessary. 99.9% of runners do not need to mess with this concept at all. Not every training week should be identical in nature (there's some training that's better done far away from your race and some that's better done closer to your race) but no one should be overtraining on purpose, even if they're scheduling extra recovery. My main takeaway from this thread is that having 3 quality days a week and running really truly easy on the other 4 days is a very effective foolproof template that everyone should try to follow. And in order to follow it, the quality days have to be easy enough to recover from that you actually recover and can sustain the training. And in order to do that, the easiest type of workout that you can do which is still effective is these easy threshold intervals, starting with as small a volume as you need to sustain it and building up to what Jakob does as a maximum volume. These sessions are what you can do on the days which precede 1 easy day. What you do for the 3rd quality day of the week, which precedes 2 easy days, can be a little more difficult and should cover a different aspect of physiological development (like doing hills / speed, or for a marathoner, a long run with some kind of tempo / fartlek). So as someone else mentioned, trial-and-error is very likely the best thing an individual can do. Doing some kind of fitness test, max heart rate test, monitoring heart rate or monitoring lactate, etc etc, should just give someone a starting point. And then it should be individual trial-and-error: can I do my 3 sessions a week indefinitely? Am I really staying on top of my recovery? That should be the top priority. Make it easy enough so that's a confident \"yes\". After that, you occasionally race. If your performances are improving, then change nothing (except what naturally changes by keeping the same perceived effort). If they plateau, then think about how you want to increase the stimulus so you can continue to improve: maybe your paces have slacked off a bit and should increase, or maybe you should increase volume a bit. Either way, make a small incremental change, make sure the training is still indefinitely sustainable, and race again in a few months. There's NO NEED to continuously compare your journey to anyone else's or to refer to a chart or any physiological measurements or anything. I understand that doing so has been massively helpful for Jakob and Gjert says it's essential, but they're attempting to reach absolutely 100% of Jakob's potential, setting literal world records. And copying them might not even work for our own physiologies. They've made no attempt to provide a universal blueprint that will work for any physiology. We should guide our own journeys. Start somewhere -- err on the side of the training being too easy -- and see if you improve or not. Get an idea for what you can handle and increase it only if necessary. Anyway, that's my takeaway. I personally have been the guy who runs relatively fast on little training, who has then taken cues from other peoples training (and not just on my own in some misguided and incorrect fashion -- I've received individualized training from coaches who have coached elites, and from elites who have gotten into coaching) in an attempt to get more serious and perhaps graduate from \"sub-elite\" to \"elite\", and then just ended up overtraining over and over and over again. If that rings a bell, I think this is a good lesson to learn. If that's not you, maybe my perspective isn't helpful. I'm too old now to ever be elite (well, there's always the masters category) but finding good training late in life is still a great gift, better late than never. I respect the people who are keen on comparing training and races in order to build general knowledge and understanding. It's an essential part of all of this. It's a worthy project and could eventually lead to comparisons actually being more useful than they are now. But for an individual just managing their own training, my strong opinion as someone who has been led astray so many times, is to use it as a starting point and then live in your own individual world. PS: I have a pet theory that a lot of sub-elites and low tier elites have been overtraining their whole lives, but not so bad that they don't improve, so they just keep doing it their whole careers. Then at some point they stop improving and they cannot possibly train any harder, so they think \"Well I hit my genetic peak. This is it.\" But they're wrong -- they could've hit a higher peak by training lighter along the way. Some of us can't improve while overtraining but I think a lot of people can and then they develop a totally warped idea about the relationship between training and performance, and that trickles down and permeates to everyone else, creating all kinds of false ideas about what kind of training is necessary to achieve a certain performance. I base this on the fact that (like I said earlier) people keep increasing their training loads before they plateau. They have so much fear about \"wasting\" a season of training by undertraining that they constantly err on the side of overtraining, but not so much that it's catastrophic, and then they end up spending their whole careers slightly overtraining, never actually training optimally. They burn out and/or plateau before they accumulate as many years of effective training (before getting too old and declining) as they could have.",

I basically took 3 days of per week and had 4 quality days. Mileage fell to 25-40 per week. Results were very good. actually amazing. Because I had little expectation for each workout (which was essentially a steady state run 8-10 miles) I would just go whatever pace my body felt like on that day. Some days were quick 5:10 pace, other days no so much 5:40 pace...but it did not bother me either way. = the problem for me was after that 1 great year, I kept trying to replicate what had worked and got fairly good again a few times, but never the same. = my thinking is the base years in college allowed me to maximize training on low mileage, but I needed to go to the base training for a while to get results again (of low mileage). So my conclusion is low mileage training works, high mileage training work, high before low works best of all. too high expectations does not work trying to copy someone else's workouts does not work",

The guy has clearly stated he's looking to get to 2.5-3.5 mmol and he's tested this. There is a ton of ways he can get to that, almost unlimited combinations of reps and paces. What that % of critical velocity is almost irrelevant to the thread and conversation. You keep bringing it up just doesn't make any sense. Obviously pace is higher, the shorter the reps. I do much longer reps mainly because the strips are expensive. So I have found 3x13 mins works great for me, at marathon pace. But I could get exactly the same response though from the lactate I am looking for, with 9x4 mins, for a completely different pace. The actual pace would be much different BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER. The different paces get you running and practicing I guess at different speeds, but the response it lactate you are eliciting from the body is the same. This thread is about getting as much training you can do, sub threshold. That's it. Nothing more. I personally think this is the best way to train and I've had great results myself. The pace is totally irrelevant. Maybe it shouldn't be mentioned. I think maybe it's confusing for people to read Spoc84 posts, as awesome as they are how he laid out the paces. They are not for you. Or for me. They are the paces he runs to get the lactate levels he is looking for.",

It's kept flowing that well. I love the idea you can run a bunch of different paces but basically get the same sub threshold response. I think that is excellent for running economy. It also feels very controlled . Something I feel with my training, I seem out of control at times. One thing that stands out - maybe I have an opinion on this as I'm currently injured again, but virtually nobody has mentioned getting injured? There has been quite a few people all posting now in follow up to spoc84 superb first few posts, but a theme almost everyone has followed with is that 1. It feels sustainable, with people seemingly doing this all year round and 2. Really nobody has mentioned feeling tired or it breaking them down and feeling injured . That is huge. I don't think I've read many long threads on letsrun where it's been sustainable, it's not a miracle quick fix then you break down but most of all people are actually getting faster. Does anyone have a theory as to why? Is it simply the recovery is easier + the lack of vo2 max stuff? I feel that's what leaves me living in the edge and usually responsible for most of my breakdowns. Anyway keep it going. Spoc, unbelief, Hard2find, shirtboy, peekay.

There's no reps left on the table, they are being specifically targeted to work up to and finish around a certain mmol of lactate. I don't think spoc84 who laid it all out on the table, runs anything marathon pace. It's quite a bit faster. In fact, some of it , maybe over half of it, is over threshold pace/velocity. But he's never going over threshold. This is very clever, measured and controlled. Him as well have laid out ways , potentially runners can measure this training load and perhaps examples of why it's working. I don't think spoc, Hard2find, shirtboy, or others pretend to be scientists, but there's been plenty of citation of guys who are. There is no backing off the quicker stuff. He doesn't do any apart from race. Again, it's not just a case of how most training works, where it's time to lay off the vo2 max stuff in training - there isn't any. At all. This isn't double threshold. It's different. The intensity is probably even a little higher but a fraction, but still not over LT2.

Many of the best coaches are not academically trained in exercise science and it hasn't stopped them from developing their approaches and sharing that with others. Regarding including VO2Max intervals or anything faster than LT (60 min race pace). I am not in line with sirpoc on that. I will include OCCASSIONAL workouts where I am running 5k-10k pace for 800m-1600m intervals, but this is usually when a few weeks out from a 5k-10k race and I have found that just 2-3 sessions are needed. Regarding doing the threshold workouts, I think a way that people can conceptualize them is as follows. If you think of doing strides, say 100m strides at 1500m pace, in that 100m you build up very little, if any, significant lactate above your baseline, even though you’re running at 1500m speed. So, if the goal is to keep your blood lactate below your 60 min threshold level, say 3.5-4.0 mmol, you could construct a variety of workouts at paces faster than LT but done in short enough intervals and with proper recovery where your blood lactate never rises above your threshold but you accumulated a high volume of work at a speed faster than it. I personally don’t take this approach as I find running at or slightly slower than LT is more productive for me, since I’m more 10k to marathon focused. However, it’s an idea to play around with for some, perhaps. Also, in the least matter of fact tone possible, correct night owl!, I’m not a physiologist, but I am actually a scientist LOL",

I've been reading more and more lately emphasising the importance of LT-pace training, and taking serious interest in the Bakken/Ingebrigtsen approach. This discussion has generated some great lightbulb moments for me. The talk of CTL, heart rate zones, maximising time at LT pace etc. has got me wanting to properly monitor changes in my own performance and fatigue metrics. Has anyone got any tips for how to get the most out of tools like Runalyze for this? I think it was sirpoc early on that mentioned he uses it.",

    "message": "Hi data nerd, your username suggests you have come to the correct thread 😂. I think there's quite a few people here who can help with different things, but I can definitely help with this. I don't use runalyze, but I hugely recommend either Golden Cheetah for the PC version or use intervals icu for mobile (it's browser based, but works fantastic in mobile brave on my android). This IMO will open things up to what is happening in your training. You'll start to see patterns and understand why you stagnate or when it's time to just do things like I suggested, like time to add on 5 mins here and there to easy runs before you add more reps. Intervals will also give you a visualisation and breakdown each week of your time in zone breakdown. This is hugely valuable. You can customise that breakdown in a number of ways. I would suggest using time in zone, pace as the main metric, with heart rate as back up and also if you have a reliable and more modern watch, select in the pace settings in intervals icu , gradient adjusted pace. You can use HR, I don't think it matters too much, you will see slightly different numbers. For me, it evens out (roughly) But the TSS per session seems slightly less for me in the easy runs by HR and slightly more in the workout sessions, than by pace. Overall, I mentioned the other day I have re evaluated the last few hundred runs and basically it ended up the same. Just stick to one though. Once you have picked , just stay with it. Obviously pace isn't as good as a power meter in cycling, which is the ultimate tool , but I can still use the PMC (it's under the fitness tab in intervals, but the same thing) to index my current fitness) roughly to my training load. The main takeaway in basic terms for me, I could only make it to maybe around a CTL (FITNESS score in intervals icu) of 50, training a more traditional running approach, on around 6.5-7 hours a week. It was only as I started to train like this for the same hours, which made my CTL increase, for no more hours. So obviously I could experiment with how to push the envelope and understand why I have gotten faster. You mention fatigue, FWIW, the fatigue/tsb score in general I've found quite accurate over the years. I once was cycling and really felt terrible from a training block, had a TSB of like -50. Over the years in cycling it gave me a pretty good idea of where I was at. I could train hard still on about -15 to -20 ish. So for me it was a good metric to use, as again I could index that score and use it for patterns over time. It was as good as telling me when I needed a break as my body. My issue was always I didn't want to believe my body, I was weak and could just push through. The numbers reigned me in. One more thing, training like this for running, you don't need to worry about this too much. I've never accumulated a fatigue score over -10, in intervals icu. That's primarily because this is so controlled, it's basically the same thing every week or at worst ramp it up a tiny bit. Cycling is a bit more variable, you might do some crazy 7 hours ride , it feels easy, but actually that load is huge under the hood and has trashed you in retrospect, more than your body initially tells you. You'd probably find this to be the case in running. That I could easy go out and run 75% of MHR for my long run, it might feel OK as an individual run in isolation, but actually if that becomes the easy standard over time, it will then grind you down (not horrifically I guess) but more than you realise. Just make sure you are 100% sure you know your threshold pace to begin with and that you know your LTHR. Also, keep those updated the second you clearly know you have improved, through a face or time trial or whatever you benchmarks are likely to be. Right, I was going to also post and bore everyone with what happened yesterday , as I got my wallet, bought some more lactate strips . Can't believe how expensive they have gotten 😭😂😂.",

It's funny, I know this guy I often see on my morning run. He's the only one training that slow on his easy based on following guys on Strava locally, but has also the fastest master in the area. He's doing something like this I think. As he's often doing 6x mile and looking at his data on Strava its like 20 beats at least under his MHR from runs he's uploaded from races. I could never understand what on earth that would accomplish or why he wasn't doing those mile repeats if not all out, much harder. My guess was it looked like about his HM pace or slightly faster. Which I just couldn't understand. I think the problem is being a workout warrior is so engrained into the sport, weirdly so. Obsessions with 3-5k pace workouts. I hold my hands up I'm as guilty as anyone. If nothing else this thread as made me want to take baby steps to breaking this cycle.",

Maybe run this through twice in the next couple of weeks and do one lot in 25x400 and test that. That'll be this box of strips done. Then if I'm happy just stick to the pace ranges for a while with confidence. Obviously it won't be perfect, some days these paces might do say 2.5 mmol and some days 3mmol and I won't know exactly which one it is (just to use a random example)- maybe not that precise for a pro.

It's ramps up very quickly and when I played around and deliberately messed up and went too hard on the final interval once, HR was not hugely over LTHR but lactate was really high. I mentioned, I could really feel that 7-8 mins in my legs the next day in a way that was quite shocking, compared to normal. It's why I would encourage people to be extra cautious to not go over, if you are going to want to do this every other day. As per my example, whilst I wasn't testing I was probably mid 2 mmol possibly even around 2.1-2 the last couple of weeks, based on post workout analysis of heart rate - but was still getting fitter to allow myself to push up from below . Seems what we have seen is very similar, it shows there are definitely patterns there to learn from. As I've said before, what one persons pace is to get to the desired mmol, might be different to someone else's. The ones I posted now, way back on page 1, appear to be transferable now to the next level of fitness for me. But that doesn't mean they always will, or will even work as a starting point for the next person. It's why I'm not really worried too much about CV or its meaning. I just do what I can go get to that nice range you see on the meter 😊 That doesn't mean pace zones and guides won't work, as there is a good margin for error , especially the range under threshold. Like I've said, I haven't use a meter for months. But , I'll make it clear for the final (or not time ha ha) a lactate meter will give you the absolute best results.",

The solution to this problem is that you can use your HR avg of the last min of your last rep. If the avg HR of the last min of the last rep is below around 92%HRmax you are in good shape. This is the best correlation i found between HR and Lactate for intensities below CV. But it is not so accurate as lactate testing. Lactate testing is more sensitive.",

    "message": "I'd recommend the Polar OH1 or whatever the new one is called - you can put it on the arm/forearm. I have used it with very good success. Much better than the wrist one on my Garmin 235. For those wanting to do this without lactate, I think it is doable using pace and HR. I did it for a few months last winter. I actually did all workouts on the treadmill so I could calibrate pace. Basically you start with a pace that is definitely doable and gradually progress the pace and the volume. I had a rough sense of my max HR, and wanted an absolute max of 90% of that. I found that workouts were manageable to recover from and stay consistent if I only approached that on the last rep or 2. And roughly, to the naked eye, mostly stable with only a few beats of HR drift in the last half of the workout. If drifting too much or getting up to 90% too early, I was going too hard. I lived in a very hilly area at that time, so I found the treadmill to be the best option to do this. Fun fact, Kristoffer Ingebrigtsen uses a wave light at the track to make sure his pace is accurate (if I'm understanding his posts correctly). So it seems the way they do it is target a pace, and monitor HR and lactate over time to ensure that it is the correct effort. No single workout is the end all or be all, so you can sort of track the values over time and adjust for the next workout. Interestingly, I have mostly had success in the winter. I have found in hot weather I end up trying to run outside and 1) workouts end up harder than intended (if I ever checked lactate I'm sure it would show this) and 2) easy runs end up with HR drift no matter what the pace is, so definitely above that 70%, and likely 75%+. I have no issues running < 70% HR in the winter. In the summer, I have not been able to run more than 2x threshold workouts per week consistently, but have compensated with a progression in the Long Run (though probably over do this). Because this is a \"long term vision\" system, I think a gradual increase is important, so it won't set you back much to start a bit below what you think you can do in terms of volume and pace on the intervals. If you can have a consistent stable HR and feel ok, you can gradually work up to where you want to be. But probably more gradually than you think.",

    "message": "Wow! This thread has really taken off again in the last two days, awesome! There are some interesting details being shared and ideas floated! I don’t want to turn this into a training manifesto (LOL), but I have a concept to pose to the group. The idea of blood lactate readings vs intensity and duration. If LT1 and LT2 are defined as a pace for a specified duration, those durations can be fairly accurately estimated using a race result. I’d even propose using a time trial as that will probably not result in as fast a time as a race but could actually prove more useful for training. Sirpoc has said, and I agree, the fatigue you carry during training usually results in a small percent reduction in training paces when compared to what you actually race at, assuming you are running consistently. It’s not that hard to find a consistent route or hit the track and do a 3K-10K time trial. Nut up folks! LOL I brought up Daniels and mentioned how I found his T pace sightly too intense when doing regular tempo interval sessions, so I ran at or slightly slower than half marathon pace instead. Well, for me, a few seconds slower per mile than my half marathon pace is a pace I could hold for 90 minutes. I mention this because the pace also correlates to about a 3.5 mmol blood lactate value for me. Which, when I was using a lactate meter, is where I settled into for my tempo interval sessions, 3.0-3.5 mmol. Tinman on a thread from YEARS ago (perhaps before I was born LOL), provided a conversion table for tempo training as follows: 4.0 mmol = 1.07*(5K_Race_Pace) 3.5 mmol = 1.10*(5K_Race_Pace) 2.5 mmol = 1.13*(5K_Race_Pace) Tinman knows there can be variations in those readings, but I believe he provided them as a general guide (this may have been before he created his calculator even). If memory serves me correct, he said the paces would approximately work out to LT, half marathon, and marathon, respectively. If you read Marius Bakken’s training page, not only does he detail his training and experience, he provides the general outline of the Ingebrigsten’s training and a link to an interview with Kristian Blummenfelt’s coach, Arild Tveiton. They all reference plenty of threshold work in the 2.5-3.5 mmol range. Brad Hudson in his book, Run Faster, references using 60, 90, and 150 minute race pace for threshold sessions. Guess what, if you do the math (and I did LOL), the multiples Tinman gives, the lactate values we see being cited by the Norwegians, the Zone 2 range commonly currently referenced… all of those work out to 60, 90, and 150 minute race pace. To associate those times with the current language, 60 minute race pace is LT1 and 150 minute race pace is LT2, with 90 minute race pace falling in between of course. Now, I tend to think most runners are not going to buy a lactate meter, lancets, and test strips. Whether it is the cost, practicality of use, or general lack of interest in being that technical. However, the associated paces are close enough. In fact, I’d call them speed barriers. Meaning, don’t see them as paces you have to hit, but paces to not exceed! Bringing this back to Jack. In 1979, Jack Daniels and Jimmy Gilbert published Oxygen Power. In it, he provides the regression equation he uses to derive his race prediction times. From that equation, you can calculate exactly your 60, 90 and 150 minute race pace if you know your vVO2Max. vVO2Max can be obtained by running a time trial (or race) that takes 8-10 minutes. It’s an estimate of course, but one that gives you a quantifiable starting point to gauge your sessions. Last point, and sorry for such a long post, even if YOUR lactate at those aforementioned race times varies from the standard BLa values, it is still a 60 minute, 90 minute, and 150 minute effort that is used to define the zones we see. Daniels amassed an incredible amount of research data. He states in his book while most runners will average a BLa of 4.0 mmol for their 60 minute pace, he’s measured runners with a range of, I believe, 2.8-7.2 mmol. I hope this reads as clear and robust as it plays in my head. Mainly, I hope it gives a different perspective and sparks further debate. P.S.

    "message": "Hi mate, FWIW the paces I posted back on the first page, I have no problem with using those as a calculation from a race, I do that all the time. It was to the people talking about LTHR race from an estimation. Not just the motivation from increased effort, it's the fact of nerves, all sorts that lead to an increased HR. As i said, there is zero chance my LTHR from the last 20 mins of my 10k race was correct. I was clearly way over LTHR. In fact, if you took my average for the entire race, it's clearly over LTHR. Until someone suggests something better, it's 20+ years old but Friel is the best solution for those wanting to do all of this with just a HRM. I don't generally hate the idea of these estimates of locked in % of paces etc, or Lexel converting them to a %of CV. The issue becomes when people run different numbers of reps, or run them different distances, different times. There is then endless variables. For instance, I can create the same level of lactate, for 25x400, through 10x1k up to 3x3k and even 4x10 mins, but the paces will be all varied. Yes you can index them to a pace, or a % of CV, but in my experience testing it doesn't create a nice linear graph, as in the easier slower reps generate less lactate and the harder/faster but shorter ones would create more. The one thing I can say for sure , is if I follow the pace guides I posted up (which are a guide , I hope people don't think they are the bible lol) that for me I will DEFINITELY be under 4mmol, I've tested this extensively. That's all I care about. I can without doubt handle that , 3 times a wee, no matter what. I also know that as I'm balls deep now for almost a year now. The one thing I think everyone has to remember, in this thread. Is just about absolutely everyone is agreeing probably 3 x sub threshold is going to probably get quite good, as it's a relatively heavy training load but also falls into that zone you can repeat multiple times a week and recover from. Hard2find, your scientific approach , along with shirtboys I really enjoy ( he clearly knows his stuff as well) I have zero academic background but I'm a very good trainer. Always have been.

Questions/discussion for the wider group: It seems to me that to maximise the potential of this training, one needs to have a very accurate estimation of lactate threshold. Has anyone gotten lab testing done for this? I think you would burn through a lot of lactate pro strips trying to accurately derive the lactate curve yourself - I guess the lactate meter is best used for spot checking to keep your workouts at the correct pace (but the actual target is largely determined by the lab test). Perhaps an occasional LT lab test is worth it for a hobby jogger using this training system? Secondly, how do you know how far below LT is optimal to train at? Can one train at any pace between LT1 and LT2 and derive a training stimulus for 5k-marathon (adjusting volume accordingly)? For example, could you simply run intervals at marathon pace 5-6 days a week and never go above that pace outside races (seen some discussion on this already)? I would guess that is taking it too far? Interested to hear anyone's thoughts. I am not being sceptical, just trying to understand!",

We all have to accept that there are people outside which are not willing to do lactate testing for whatever reason. So the question, 'can we do the 'norwege' stuff without using a lactate meter', makes a lot of sense to me. And it seems to be possible by checking the avg HF of the last min of the last rep. Not 100% accurate, but good enough for any non-professional. i have seen others mentioned that idea too. There is still not even one intervention study which shows that training by lactate is better than training by HR. Since decades! Therefore counter arguments have their place and i have the feeling that any counter argument from others are now not welcome. That should be not the case we should be still (very) open for counter arguments. At least i am. Race distance, muscle fiber distribution, vlamax (ability to produce lactate) and others, they all play a role and should be considered. It's individual.",

I like to write the first one with a duration value because this is the relevant pysiological variable not the km. In both cases we have 30min of total volume. So we have the total volume, we have the duration of the reps and we have the 60sec rest interval. That limits the number of combinations dramatically. If 30min of volume is enough for pros, maybe 20-25minutes as total volume is enough for the amateurs, by keeping the duration of the reps. The intensities i described in detail above.

Bar JS as usual trying to mess it up and Lexels weird infatuation with CV, it was really, really good. Btw Lexel, I actually kind of understand what you mean. I think you just don't communicate very well maybe, or maybe you are a bit too married and anchored to CV. But I actually kind of see your point, I'm just not entirely convinced it's an improvement on anything offered here. In fact this thread was very simple to understand, which is the point. Bringing % of CV complicates it more I think for your average Joe than just saying run the 1ks at 15k pace or using the HRM solution offered. I stopped to Google and familiar myself with stuff like TSS, CTL and the PMC which didn't take long, then all that stuff made sense as well - I really learned something there and I am going to back catalogue my own data myself. I think what sets this thread apart is anyone can do it. We often have ex sub elites or current saying \"this is how you must train to run sub 15\" . But they are talented, have only trained one way (usually not like this) and we have NO IDEA what they could have run, had they trained like this, arguably more optimally. Here we have spoc84 in particular, as well as others - who have COMPARISONS to other ways they have trained. That is the key difference. We have something to base this off. As often we have natural runners who say \"this is how you must train\" when actually, often, even being sub 15, I think \"you could have done more\". Lets not forget, spoc isn't slow. He's just run 35.50 or something like that. That's not slow. That's way above average, even for letsrun. The key takeaway is that it's been compared, to another way to train - we don't often get that and solid rationale for why this way is better via the overall training load talk. I have no idea where he sits in terms of being fast, for cycling, but seems faster to me than his running? So that's two sports he's trained to make him way above average, relatively the same way. That makes me sit up and notice. Also I always enjoy shirtboys posts. Also very informative. Would love more little links like that , if possible. Hard2find, also really enjoyed your posts from the scientific point of view.

I use it every run, workout, warm up etc. and I noticed after about 3 months it was very accurate. For example, as a slow hobby jogger my LT pace is about 6:50 per mile and the corresponding power was 288 watts. I did a workout a few days ago and ran slightly faster than my usual LT pace and both my watches estimated threshold pace and my power increased accordingly. I also noticed that when it updated it was almost bang on my LTHR Hr of 164 when doing intervals. The critical power it estimates is essentially LT2. I find it useful to focus on a single metric rather than pace and hr at the same time. And of course is less invasive than the finger prick.

It's literally plug and play. The only issue you have is variation between different power meters, but the one you plan to use for all your training works on the first day, the same it works on the last day. I'm guessing it must use stuff like heart rate and estimation in its \"power\" calculation .There was a Cyclops power meter maybe 7-8 years ago, that was aimed for cycling - which was basically a soft strap heart rate band - that did something similar, guesstimated power based on an algorithm they claimed to have made from thousands of users data. This sounds similar I guess . Maybe I'll get one again, pop it on my shoe for a few months, forget about it and look it later. I'm very lucky though, I live in a flat area and can also run laps if I want to even out on the road, so that's another reason why pace was my first choice .",

I tried the spoc/Kristoffer system this week, just did my third workout this morning. Felt so controlled and purposeful, and have done more actual 'work' than past weeks with monstrous VO2 sessions. I actually like the routine of it - there's no room for excuses, no uncertainty about what workouts you are going to thrash yourself on in a given week.

Jack Daniels (jtupper) posts on it too. They were talking about this 19 years ago! Tinman references Jan Olbrecht on the thread. His book, The Science of Winning, is an excellent source for those interested in how bioenergetics and lactate interplay, as well as the athletes individual physiology. Btw, I believe he was the originator of the 30 min TT that cycling coaches later picked up and called Functional Threshold. He didn’t think it anymore useful than other tests though because it didn’t provide any insight into what the mechanism driving the results was. Sorry lexel LOL With that out of the way, I agree with the sentiment that we all agree on the generalities of this training approach. I don’t think there is one definitive way you have to train. To me, the superior way is the way that gets you fit and keeps you progressing and inspired! @Unbelief. There is such a range of terminology and quantification when it comes to LT1 and LT2 that I would never say, “It has to be this value.” I only gave the values to share what Tinman wrote (even though I did so incorrectly). I’m not that dogmatic nor insistent LOL. I’ve seen LT1 (the initial rise in lactate above baseline), given as 2.0-2.5 mmol in the research. I’ve even seen some refer to it as a 1.0 mmol rise above baseline. This is part of my point on why runners without a lactate meter (even those with one who are disinclined to order more strips) can use paces at different time durations and be confident they are in the correct range. Personally, as sirpoc has also shared, I go by effort. I know the feeling I want to have at different stages of the workout and try to tune in to that sensory data. I find it’s also helpful to have that ability to utilize in races to properly allocate your energy. There is however a positive linear relationship between oxygen up take and intensity. That relationship, averaged for all runners is what allows for the race and training pace formulas we see from Daniels and others like Tinman and Mcmillan. Those make use of the fact that the percentage of ones VO2 Max being used for any given duration is the same. If you set a distance, say 10K, and one runner covers it in 30 minutes and the other in 40 minutes, those runners will be at approximately 93% and 91% of their VO2Max, respectively. However, set time as the standard and both athletes will be working at the same relative effort in relation to their max but one will cover more distance in that time. All that bloviating to say, equating workouts and workload is likely more accurate and easily achieved by using pace in relation to max effort for a duration, not lactate. That’s largely why, forced to by no one but myself, I’d advocate 30 minute, 60 minute, 90 minute, and 150 minute race paces. One it allows for variety, which it’s said is the spice of life. Two, it spans the spectrum of intensities which show really good bang for your buck, while also fitting into the “Tempo Training” approach we are discussing. Plus, it’s sustainable over the long term. In the context of the three workouts per week and very much in line with what sirpoc is doing already would be the following 1. 90 sec repeats @ 30 min RP = 1.03*5K_Pace 2. 3 min repeats @ 60 min RP = 1.07*5K_Pace 3. 6 min repeats @ 90 min RP = 1.10*5K_Pace A fourth option for when the kids are at the grandparents and the wife is on a Real Housewives bender. 4. 12 min repeats @ 150 min RP = 1.13*5KPace You could use 1 min recoveries for all of those and just scale the volume to suit your fitness and savagery.",

I think. Which ultimately is what we are trying to do. This is even easier than me saying to my absolute beginner friend, who just wants to run, but start out doing some intervals , go run 5x1k at 15k Pace. FWIW , over time I would guess looking at those paces they are about what I would already target (not always hit, +-1%) and that over time, for me, would probably even out all the distances to roughly the same amount of lactate, comparing sessions. In fact, the most variable distance in terms of lactate for me, are the 5x2k sessions. That has had the widest range, when I have tested . Right down to 2.1 mmol once and absolutely up to the limit, another time. I've noticed this for KI as well on his longer repeats. I've also not noticed my pace being way too fast or his either. I've noticed this is the distance/ time you haven't covered. Around 7-9 minutes. Maybe that's the range the body is less predictable. Just a side note anyway.",

You do a session that you probably can finish -- if you arent feeling great on that day, just chuck it and move on, you got 2 more in the week. So you're good to go. Also, you will be able to track your progress pretty easily, with or without lactate, especially if you at least use a HR strap. You will start noticing little ques in your workouts that will tell you a lot about the workout and how you are feeling on that given day that you can go by. From using lactate/HR you can guess a lot of these significant events/when you are starting to drift into domains of stress you arent intending to. Look at all these Jakob interviews.

Does this come to you as a big surprise I guess? Already back then they did \" double thresholds\". As some commentators in this thread already told this way of training threshold functions best with high mileage because the threshold pace is not individual optimal to trigger the lactate threshold development on low mileage. So, now to your questions. How would I coach SPOC 84, Kristoffer and the mighty Jakob Ingebrigtsen? Well, it doesn`t matter their different levels. What`s important to them all is this practical fundamental expression, \" Listen to your heart\". The individual heart is always telling you the shape of the day . Then you have to know at what effort you have to work to give the very best outcome of your workouts and easy runs. When going the low mileage way the lactate threshold training have to be most effective and more direct and close to \"maximum individual threshold pace\" in just one single session on a day compared to the \"double thresholds\" on lower concentration of lactate. I of course believe I could get Jakob running even faster at all distances with my method, but that hypothesis of course we will never get to know if it`s correct or not .))",

I genuinely go by effort and will look at paces and heart rate, and BLa readings (when I was testing) after the workout. I often experiment with different workout formats each year too. I got into doing workouts that always totaled 60 minutes several years ago. I simplified it down to three variation. A straight 60 minute tempo, tempo intervals with a 4:1 run to recovery ratio (so could be 12*4 min w/ 1 min up to 3*16 min w/ 4 min), and a fartlek with a 1:1 run to recovery ratio (typically 30*1min On/Off or 15*2min On/ Off). I observed that I would approximately average marathon pace on each of them, even though I was running different paces during the tempo, intervals, and fartlek. One could always scale that down (or up) and get essentially the same physiological benefit as the workouts I listed in the previous post. I really don’t think there is a magic set of workouts, more importantly a magic effort to tap into consistently over time to build fitness and enjoy the process! Anyway… LOL Regarding your variation in BLa on the 2K repeats, interesting! My initial reaction would be that the pace you are running for them is flirting with your LT2. If you look at plots of BLa as a function of a constant pace run over time, for the first 5 minutes or so, there is not always a significant rise in the reading when comparing a pace that steady states versus the next speed up that causes the lactate to rise precipitously. However, around 10 minutes, there will be a separation and then a further separation at each interval thereafter for however long the readings are taken. Btw, per your suggestion, I have really been looking into the TSS and CTL. I need some time to code everything up but along the lines of what you mentioned about trying to optimize your time training to get to the level you want is where I’m going with that.

    "message": "I’ve wanted to reply to you and was hoping to spark a similar discussion as your second question posed with my 60, 90, 150 minute “thresholds” suggestion, which in no way are original. At this point in time as it relates to training, I think we are playing a game of refinement and not inventing. Plenty of coaches use these ranges, just in different forms of implementation. Some use straight tempos, some long intervals, some short intervals. Modifying the run to recovery ratio allows for a lot of possibilities. I think a lot depends too on the type of “system” you follow. For instance Jack Daniels is very, what I would call physiological parameter based. That is to say he looks at it as you want to improve your aerobic conditioning, lactate threshold, aerobic power, and running economy (he calls this speed too). To do that he thinks that running at the intensity to stress that physiological function is the best way to improve it. Hence, his Easy, Threshold, Interval, and Repetition paces. A lot of coaches have that same belief but will assign a range of paces to stress those functions. This is more the idea that, like muscle fibers, paces lie on a continuum and by manipulating the intensity, duration, and recovery, you can get the same stimulus as adhering strictly to one pace for each of the four physiological variables. Daniels himself has stated he believes marathon pace provides not physiological benefit that isn’t gained from running at the upper limit of his Easy pace, but he does make mention of doing continuous tempo runs longer than his standard 20 min at T pace. He even provides a chart in his second edition on how to adjust pace relative to duration. At 60 minutes, the pace (for most runners) converges to marathon pace. Jan Olbrecht, Renato Canova, Marius Bakken, and others, in slightly different ways, talk about how doing too much at or beyond LT will actually “pull the threshold down”. That is , you may be able to produce high levels of lactate as a result, but you will actually lower the speed at which your threshold occurs. You can think of this as your lactate curve shifting left or up and out to the left. Hence why they and many others like to use paces slower than what Daniels defines as T pace. However, depending on your event of focus, that may be a desirable trade off. Regarding lab testing, I’m near a large research university and they have a physiology department where you can go for VO2Max testing and/or lactate threshold testing. They even offer a discount for repeat visits. If you are just interested in your lactate curve though, I think you can achieve that on your own. Using a track (try as best you can to keep the pain even) or treadmill. The standard I see is to run 5 3 minute segments at an increasing intensity. I personally don’t think that’s enough of a step count to get a really well defined curve (assuming such a thing exists LOL). I generally go for 10 5 minute steps. It helps to have a good idea of where your threshold may be and aim for a 4-5% increase in pace. Also I try and get 2 readings that are definitively beyond the LT2. Hope that is helpful.",

I wouldn’t go by the mmol value though and was simply using LT1 and LT2 to give a range for the 60 and 150 minute paces. I’ve tried to be clear when using the different terminology but maybe I should have clarified that more directly. Also, I was not at all suggesting you should go run time trials at those durations. That would be masochistic LOL. I think I was pretty clear you can estimate them using Jack Daniels formula he has published. Which perhaps I should share so that everyone knows what I’m using to get the values. %VO2Max = 0.8 + 0.1894393*EXP(-0.012778*time) + 0.2989558*EXP(-0.1932605*time) Where time is expressed in minutes. From that you can predict the pace you can hold for the 60, 90, and 150 minute durations by using your pace at VO2Max. You could use the 8 hour figure you proposed unbelief and for that you would get a pace that is 3% slower than the 150 minute pace I suggested.

    "message": "(This is data-nerd, logged in) As I hope I have indicated, I am a complete beginner on this and am only reflecting what I have learned reading this thread and some side research in the meantime. So I write this with the utmost respect, to all but JS, and forgive me if I am repeating what everyone already knows. My collected thoughts are thus: To bring it back to the 'Norwegian system', which for argument's sake let's say is that outlined by Bakken on his website. Bakken argues: So, the Bakken system involves two key characteristics: lots of LT training and lots of volume. The common refrain on this forum has been that the former goes hand-in-hand with the latter - hobby joggers, don't even bother. What makes this thread so interesting is that, as pointed out by spoc initially, we observe significant progress from K Ingebrigtsen running pure sub-threshold with a modest amount of volume. Spoc and others have also observed this in themselves, with further (very interesting) corroborating evidence from cycling experiences. This suggests that the pure lactate development approach relies less on volume than implied by Bakken and the conventional wisdom, though I think we can forgive Bakken who had the elite athlete in mind. It seems the more important factor to reaching one's potential is spending as much time as possible in the 'lactate state', maximising capabilities at LT. Perhaps the hobby jogger with a job and kids has hope, after all? So, in our fixed and limited time available, we do as much volume as we can. It's not 180km a week, but that's ok, we're not trying to win medals. The remaining, and more influential, variable is time spent in the 'lactate state'. How do we know we are in the desired lactate state? In my view the only direct way is measuring the amount of lactate in the blood, with reference to lactate concentration at the anaerobic threshold (which varies between individuals). Heart rate, pace and power at LT may be observed but are ultimately anchored to the lactate measurement. What sticks out (to me) about this 'Norwegian system for hobby joggers', other than the apparent revelation that volume is not essential, is that it involves systematic observations of parameters. Tinman, Jack Daniels, Pfitzinger, all the tables and calculators are based on averages. Instead of assessing performance by 'did I hit the prescribed pace that would put the 18:00 5K runner in the lactate state', its 'did I reach MY lactate state, and is this providing adequate stimulus over time?' Is this an accurate summary? (I spent way too much time writing this)",

I just thought it interesting and fun to share with the thread, particularly for those, if any, who enjoy that component. The reason I brought up the 60-90-150 is, as I stated, several coaches use those paces, approximately. Specifically, I was taking what Tinman provided on a thread once, checking them against what Daniels would predict and discovered they worked out to 60-90-150 minute race efforts. So wanted to share and spark some input/pushback from others. It seems I have and that's good. I wanted to see if people felt there was significance to them any more than 2.5, 3.0, and 4.0 mmol might hold. I agree that they are arbitrary times but times that Tinman stated are approximately associated with the 4.0, 3.0, and 2.5 mmol level. I’m not going to refute someone of his experience and knowledge. I’ll concede that LT1 and LT2, as I used it to relate the low and high end of Tinman’s paces, may not align with what those terms represent in other literature but in relation to what he presented, I thought they were accurate representations and stated the context in which I meant them to be thought of. I’ve read a lot of data that has been reported on runners, including in some cases their lactate curve, by Jack Daniels, Joe Vigil, Brad Hudson, Terence Mahon, Bob Larsen, David Martin, and others. To me, if these physiologists and coaches are defining Aerobic Threshold and Lactate Threshold, which would be the terms I’d use (though perhaps Lactate Threshold and Lactate Turn Point are the current vernacular) and showing data that aligns with roughly a 60 minute and 150 minute effort, I believe them. Again, perhaps it was a semantical issue to use LT1 and LT2 instead of AT and LT, but I have seen LT1 called the aerobic threshold (and defined as approximately 2.5 to 3.0 hour race pace) and LT2 called the lactate threshold (and defined as 60 minute race pace). I don't see that as being confused or uniformed, just perhaps a reflection of environment and sources. Also, no, I am not the spreadsheet guy. That was a legit and resourceful use of Daniels conversion formulas though. Credit to him!",

I think you could also do two workouts per week and a long run. The two workouts can total 30 minutes of work (i.e. 10*3 min, 6*5 min, 3*10 min) and if the long run is done progressively, it’s a very similar stimulus overall. I’m sure most are aware of the study that showed that while running at an easy pace, once the duration reached, I believe around 105 minutes, Type 2a muscle fibers(think intermediate fibers, between slow twitch and fast twitch) were recruited. The same fibers that would be activated/recruited when running in a tempo pace range. So even though the intensity was not at the same level, the duration “forced” the recruitment as Type 1 fibers fatigued. So, from a fiber perspective it has a similar stimulus, even more so if you push the pace down a little toward the end.",

I've said before, I am not a scientist in the slightest , but I do understand I think how to make the most of my training, without getting injured. Cycling was a lot of trial and error, over a long period of time and running has been copying some of that and having the great resource that is KI and his Strava, to double check and even copy whether I'm in the right ball park. It's clearly worked wonders for him on 7-8 hours a week and I'm very happy with my results. Like you say, Bakken and obviously others , usually are at worse describing what optimal training is for sub elites, but it's usually actual elites. So it's about tweaking and moving things, to fit for slower runners or those time crunched. There's obviously debate on the fine tuning of this, going back and forth. But I still stick by what I posted in page 1. The paces I would target if I was doing this with no lactate testing whatsoever. Or , a bit trickier, if you are going to try and run to HR (I find this more difficult) , doing the Job Friel test and basically just targeting his sub threshold zone with the caution being on you don't go over your LTHR. This can be done, but definitely much trickier in the moment, especially the 1k intervals I do regularly. But Either of this options makes it incredible hobby jogger friendly in the initial spirit of this thread, as bar maybe a suggestion I gave someone who was determined to go by HR to go and buy a £15 a HR chest strap, nobody needs to buy anything fancy - and still probably get very close to where they need to be.",

I've read some of this through twice. My main take out from this is I'm probably NOT maximising my training load with a lot of moderate, long run, a vo2 session and a Daniels 20-25 min tempo. I've been stuck in this cycle for a while. So everything spoc said really rings true. I totally get what he means when he said he couldn't get past a certain point. I started reading in real time on the first page so I have already done a week training like this. Obviously I have not noticed any difference in performance, but I think someone else mentioned, I feel a purpose. The sessions feel tough, but there doesn't feel like there's the same fatigue next day like a Daniels straight tempo or a vo2 session. It's also great to run easier, on the easy day. It doesn't feel too slow and you can understand WHY you are doing it, with knowing 24 hours later you'll be going again. Spoc , just wanted to say thank you for making everything you say pretty clear, you discredit yourself with saying you aren't scientific. Your understanding of what is happening I think it's way beyond most old skool coaches. You don't pretend to know everything and it's nice to see other posters with a more scientific background come and fill in any blanks or make reason of WHY this appears to be working for yourself, Jacobs brother and others.",

LOL There is a thread from 19 years ago, No Interval Work Success, that closely resembles what we are discussing. There’s a lot of good information there, both shared experiences and links to resources. Steve Magness’ The Science of Running, discusses individual variability and gives practical examples of how one can modify training to meet those variations. It’s one of the few mainstream training books on running that I’ve seen do that. I think we all agree, it comes back to training individually, both for your physiology, the event you’re targeting, and life constraints. My take away, when looking at the three different approaches discussed (lactate readings, heart rate percent, and pace as a percent of race pace at another distance) is that they all aim to achieve the same thing and attempt to standardize/communicate it through their respective metrics. Each has validity, but also nuance that as long as the person applying it is aware of allows for a physiological information exchange that is ultimately used to track and assess training and progress. Lactate readings, HR max percent, or the pace as a fraction of vVO2Max are all just metrics through which we have discovered we can measure the stress we imposed by running at a certain intensity for a certain duration.",

To be clear, I am not going out and buying a lactate pro (maybe one day), but am still giving the training a go. I still think the Norwegian system, strictly speaking, is based on the concept of the lactate threshold (LT2/anaerobic) and that blood lactate is the most meaningful measure of training stimulus (both of which are far from ironclad assumptions, from my interpretation of the literature). But of course, as you say (and Hard2find) we can get very close by using other measures. Again, to repeat your previous posts, perhaps with less precision it pays to be a little more conservative, approach the correct pace from below, and listen to the body.",

A TdF rider and pro is so optimally endurance trained that findings about his high training volume don't really fit the thread (low mileage). I beg to correct myself: aerobic threshold, unless you do a meticulous and systematic check of blood values, varies between 10k race pace and half marathon race pace in runners according to a rule of thumb. That's about 85% of maximum heart rate, roughly speaking (but no more than 90%). A very well trained runner will run close to an hour at aerobic threshold, less good ones can't. If I'm not mistaken, someone who trains low mileage and therefore doesn't favor a marathon or half marathon most of the time because he or she is not optimally trained should do the threshold training in uncomplicated everyday life at about 10k race pace. That sets good training incentives. Anything else would be too slow in that case.",

Whereas for me, I just jog out to my local parkrun and do that as often as I can. Again, it's just the finer details of things overall - but you are right it's worth mentioning. You are gonna mess about up sometimes anyway, it'll happen. For whatever reason. KI is using pace to guide him and the meter to check on the results of the session, presumably to shape the rest of the week depending on the reading. Unless you test every rep or every other rep. That will happen. But I still think most of the time you'll be absolutely fine, which, in general means you are probably getting almost the most you. n still from this. If you go into lactate threshold or over for 3-4 mins at the end of the last 2 reps, does it matter? Probably not too much if it's just the odd mistake here and there. Is it ideal? No, as in my experience you do actually feel it,even for not very long. As for Froome, well Tean Sky were married to this approach for a while. Wiggins was famous for his sub threshold efforts in his garden shed, hitting specific targets (Tim Kerrison?) that were given to him. He Laos loved TSS and CTL, as a side note. There still needs to be the X factor for the absolute elite, to set them up. When I was cycling and racing for the UK time trial scene, I basically just did all sub threshold to maximise the time I had this was perfect for time trialing. I was and am a horrible road racing. My Anaerobic capacity was shocking and I could probably be beat in terms of power output for a sprint on the trainer, by a lot of random untrained. With Froome, whilst he doesn't need the violent accelerations, he could up the tempo and hold just below his threshold for the long mountains, he does need that range where if he has to follow, he has to follow. Although Geraint Thomas and Wiggins both proved you probably can win the TDF as just an absolute threshold/sub threshold monster in the high mountains, with basically, one pace. 40/20 is the classic cycling session. I have also done 10x1 with float recovery as my X factor session. That's 1 min zone 6 with a minute at low zone 3. Probably the most violet session I've ever done and something that definitely improved my overall package.

    "message": "This was a topic I was just thinking about myself, so glad you asked it! There are a few ways I think about this from a “training system” approach. If you approach training as wanting to recruit and stimulate the spectrum of your muscle fibers, then you would be leaving some fibers behind if you never ran faster than, say 5km pace. Hill repeats are a great method to recruit these extra fibers because they require more force to propel yourself forward, even though the pace isn’t as fast, and thus will recruit more fibers because of that. They also seem to not change your lactate curve by much, if any. Some will refer to this as non-specific lactate work. That is work at a high (relative to the individual runner) lactate reading but that doesn’t result in the deterioration of your lactate curve. Steve Magness has written about this and even produced data on it. I’d assume it’s still on his Science of Running blog. If you’re more of a train the physiological system person, per Daniels, then you can simply think of it as a repetition workout to improve your economy and speed. Daniels doesn’t seem to talk much about bioenergetics and how the different workouts can influence your lactate curve, not that that’s the sole goal of training. He does emphasize that you train like an individual though. How much and how regularly you do different sessions likely just depends on what distance you’re training for and your personal physiology. For 1500m, being able to generate and tolerate those higher levels is certainly a factor. For a marathoner, hills or a-lactic speed work works well, since the goal is largely to shift your LT curve as far out to the right as you can (as well as bring your AT as close to LT too), you don’t want to be countering that with workouts that would do the opposite. I think it all comes back to individuality and balance! This is why most 1500m runners are not the best marathoners and visa versa. Each has a particular physiological make up that lends itself better to different race distances. I identifying that and then training to your specific needs is going to bring you as near your potential as possible. Btw, sirpoc, I agree with the poster who said not to discredit yourself just because you don’t have a science background. You’re providing great insight into your training with relevant metrics, seeking to understand it, keeping an open mind, experimenting and adapting, and improving! That’s the scientific method right there, to me. When I got into running, after a year or two of reading the typical training books and articles, I made an effort to learn the physiology. While I did learn a lot in a technical sense, both biochemically and physiologically, I can honestly say that not a whole lot has changed as far as the structure I use and the workouts I run. Talk about a poor return on investment LOL.",

Spoc seems to have a high content of ST (slow twitch) muscle fibers and therefore he will never become a good sprinter as those fibers can't be transfered to FT (fast twitch) fibers (at least most believe so). That also explains why he can handle 3Q +L session per week, because he uses a lot of ST fibers, which need a shorter recovery time. Having a high content of ST fibers is very good for lactate removal, and therefore his lactate levels are not comparable to others.",

    "message": "Hi Lexel, could you explain more? I'm a bit confused by this. Obviously FT and ST fibres make a different. But why can't we use anything spoc says? He's posted up numbers. His lactate pro 2 results are very much in line with the average or general person and he knows from reading all the posts what his lactate threshold is. It's not like he's reaching his lactate threshold at some weird high or low numbers. We are 19 years on and what he has found is very much in line with Tinman's estimations from the thread hard2find posted up. So even though he is clearly a terrible sprinter in running, apologies to spoc but you are horrific sprinting on a bike lol I still don't think that invalidates anything. Funny anecdote, but most of us interested in 5k + are probably very slow twitch anyway. Farah went to his kids school sports day in full kit and got beat in 100m by a dude in jeans in the dad's race. Lexel you have a strange habit of not really explaining things. Or making blanket statements . Or just thinking you are definitely correct and everyone else is wrong.

    "message": "Not that you asked, but…If I were going to explain it…and keep it VERY simple: Slow Twitch = Type 1 Fast Twitch = Type 2a and Type 2x Lactate generated by the fibers increases as you move from slow twitch to fast twitch. The faster you run, the more energy you derive from glucose (there’s an inverse linear relationship between fat utilization and carbohydrate utilization as exercise intensity increases). Fast twitch fibers require more glucose and thus, produce more lactate. The fibers have different “lactate transport” qualities as well. Slow twitch fibers will use the lactate to convert to energy. So while the fast twitch fibers are producing more lactate, the slow twitch fibers are absorbing it, in very simple terms. By doing consistent endurance training over time, the Type 2a fibers will take on more of the characteristics of the Type 1 fibers, so they can further aid in the lactate absorption/conversion process. Paces in the range of easy to tempo, roughly, are what stimulate these adaptions. Think more and/or denser mitochondria, capillaries, enzymes and efficient transport ability in the muscles. The specifics of how you do the workouts to generate these changes are largely based on that fiber make up the athlete possesses. If you are heavier on the slow twitch side maybe more volume at tempo and longer runs in general will maximize your potential. Conversely, if you’re more on the fast twitch side, slightly faster paced workouts, even though you’re targeting the same adaption will bring about your optimal fitness.",

I think this one has a wind sensor, the last one definitely didn't. Much like a cycling power meter, I don't actually expect it to generate a realistic number, just as long as it's accurate. That was my issue before. It simply couldn't have been based on my testing. Whereas whilst a cycling power meter doesn't actually know your power, it's pretty consistent. This would definitely be an interesting metric if it works better than before. I'm glad you are having a play around with TSS and CTL. With your scientific background it would be interesting to see if you can index it to performance, as I know many others in cycling have, but for running. I've definitely seen patterns there and it really helped me realise training like this in singles with 3 sub Threshold days is actually a pretty damn high training load compared to how a more classic running program might be structured, for the same hours/miles. But I will reiterate that using metrics like this are only useful if you are sure the data you are collecting, is accurate. Which is why I race as often as I can, so I can update zones etc. If I say went 8-10 weeks with no racing, you can be assured I was probably getting hugely over inflated TSS scores for the back end especially for that period, if I then PB in my parkrun. There is then not much I can learn from the PMC. I probably sound like a broken record, but I can't over emphasise this enough. It's where I think 90% of people at least don't use these sort of metrics properly. I'm not doing my 10 miler until October, but I don't intend on really changing anything of my training. A month out I might double up on 2x5k weekly with one other session or throw in 4x10 mins to the mix instead of one of the shorter sessions. But very little change otherwise.",

My wrist sensor reads a little higher, but consistently higher at least, but if you want to see what's happening during the rep, the chest strap is better. Secondly, yes, your LTHR is the highest point you want your HR to be. You should be touching that on the last rep AT MOST. As an example, if you do 6x1600 and you hit nearly your LTHR on rep 2, you've gone too hard. It'll be way over by rep 6. Thirdly, for me, I don't check at all during, I trust the paces I've set that I've shared. With a lot of testing, I've found for those distances and durations I don't need to check heart rate. Naturally , even across a variety of conditions , it will keep me in that sub threshold zone in terms of HR as well as lactate tested in the past. This keeps the running very smooth as I can just focus on keeping a nice even pace in the zones I've set. One the first rep, my HR takes a while to creep up. It's probably not in the zone we are talking about until 3-4 minutes, going back to use the 6x1600 example. My HR will drop maybe 40-45 beats in the 60 seconds at the end of each rep, but will very quickly rise straight back into the target zone within a very short space of time, when I get going again. I'm not quite sure you mean for the last bit, but my experience of the Friel test is its as accurate as you can get in a field test. Do 30 minutes as a time trial, pick a distance you are likely to hit in 30 mins based off your times - for example for me I would pick maybe 8.5k and pace it like a race. Take the last 20 minutes of that run and use it's average HR, find 98% of it and then use that as your LTHR. It's definitely more accurate than taking or guessing it from races. Mine would be way too high from my recent 10k - you just can't replicate racing HR in training for a number of reasons. Say you are doing 36 mins of work in 6x1600, you should start to see the back end of the later reps creeping up towards that Friel field test LTHR. The whole point of us boxing this up into smaller reps, is the fact we can do a bigger chunk of time and running faster , at a lower lactate, than if we ran it all straight.",

There is some training benefit from this of course, but the whole point here is we are pushing to create as much lactate as we can, to get the maximum training load. It is the running version of cycling sweetspot, how I see it, in terms of getting your best bang for you buck. Over time it maximises the training load versus realistic recovery + repeatability.

    "message": "Daniels used to come and spend two days guest lecturing at a running camp I attended in the early 2000s, up at the Olympic Training Center in Lake Placid. Aside from being a great storyteller and incredibly warm and approachable, I appreciated the numerous qualifiers he would impart when talking about his book. He was always careful to emphasize that his tables are starting points that do not account for things like differences in economy and other individual traits of his athletes. I certainly can’t speak on his behalf, but I think the nuance and use of physiological markers to individualize training even within session would be right up his alley. Another poster a few pages back linked an article on Chris Froome using sessions with lactate over 4.0, and wondered about sessions where the Ingebrigstens go over 4.0 as well. I seem to recall from Daniels’ lectures (granted, pushing 20 years ago!) an impression that there is value in teaching your body not only to clear lactate faster by doing volume below the LT, but also teaching your body to run with as little interruption to economy as possible by doing some regular running above threshold (though not too much, so as to avoid interrupting the rest of the training week). Hence, the relatively intense 20 minute tempo as well as what Daniels called cruise intervals (what we’re all describing as 5-6 minutes at 2.5-3.5 mmol lactate). I think that a system that works that 2.5-3.5 or 4.0 range exclusively may be going too far off the deep end. There is value in integrating a bit of volume above 4.0, as most of us will presumably exceed that value while racing. What the Norwegians bring to the table is the idea that the volume of running possible in the 2.5-4.0 range is extraordinarily high if done correctly, and the necessity of running anything that produces above 4.0 is minimal (though, I think, not non-existent).",

As others have noted, even a small volume above 4.0 can really be felt days later.

I'll keep this thread updated and see if there's any consistency to % of running FTP for the range of efforts. I'm going to judt go off my cycling principle and estimate my FTP based on my 5 k this morning. My PB for 10 miles on the bike and 5k for running are within 30 seconds of each other and the conversion always worked out very well. i.e what I could do for 25 miles (Coggan's definition of what FTP was based on many arguments on the time Trialling forum) was 94% of my 10 mile pace so matter what my actual fitness levels were. That's possible highly individual to me, but let's see if it translates to running. So, FTP I'm setting as 94% of this morning's new 5k PB. Incidentally , I bought a new watch finally to make the most of this Stryd - and it has native Garmin power. A little side, I don't know how it calculates power - it's 50w up on the stryd, however, the power plots are VERY and I mean VERY closely matched. Which is a big suprise. Anyway, this thread has totally slowed down but I figure this could really be useful long term, if we can get consistent data to add to the paces and % of LTHR we have spoken about.",

    "message": "Hi mate, I've had many a chat as many others have with Coggan on the Time Trialing forum over the years. He sticks to his guns, that FTP is roughly the power a well trained rider can do for a 40km / 25 mile Time Trial. For me this was around 48-50 mins depending on the terrain. What I mean is, I did 10 mile time trials often as well as 25 mile TTs. I was in the 18 min range for a 10 mile. I very consistently hold about 94% of my 10 mile power for 25 miles. So if I hadn't races a 25 in a while, I would just use 94% of my 10 mile power to set my FTP. My 5k running time is only 30 seconds faster than my 10 mile TT, so I'm going to work on the same theory. 94% of this as a guestimate for my FTP. I hope that makes sense. Note: I'm not saying do this for everyone. But it worked out consistently for years and years on the bike for me, that I have pretty good confidence in it - so let's see how it translates to running. If it does, it will be a pretty useful starting point.",

I'm more focused on middle distance events myself, but I think the approach discussed here is still applicable, even if the specifics aren't entirely. Hell, we could even get philosophical and take some life lessons from this. We've all got limited time, to various extents, and so we should try to use it as effectively as possible. That means doing the most amount of productive work possible, whilst taking the long view and realising that any time spent injured or burnt out is time not spent being productive. One another note, it seems like the blood lactate threshold corresponds somehow to another physiological threshold of fatigue, which starts to accumulate very quickly if you go above it. I wonder if anyone has any idea why this is? To my knowledge it's not because lactic acid is actually doing any damage directly. Marius Bakken talks a lot about muscle tone, but I'm not sure how widely accepted/understood this is.",

Perhaps the whole force, impact etc. is definitely a factor in this. I do think understanding this , will be ultimately what makes this style of training successful.

He is doubling up 2x days and that's a whole another topic. He's possibly doing both sessions more controlled than ours - and like you say the morning one is very easy, relatively. I *might* go beyond 10k of work, like Kristoffer has, but you also need to increase the length of your daily runs and long runs slowly to allow for this progression. For example, at first he was doing 3x3k but finally stretched that to 4x3k after he started to increase his overall volume. He's at 8+ hours a week. I'm barely touching 7. Whatever I do, if you read back, I'm around 75/25 in terms of work in zones. That is split between under 70% HR in simplistic terms for the easy/75 and almost all of the 25 (apart from park runs) are sub threshold. I think this is about the limit, give or take a couple of percent. If I wanted to do more, I would actually like to see the easy creep up nearer 80%, before I added on extra distance to the sun threshold days. I think you can probably get away with low to mid 70s in terms of \"easy\" running percentage on reasonably low hours (which is what I consider my training). Much higher than the 8+ for someone like Kristoffer I, then you are into doubles territory potentially being the best way. That's a whole different ball game as I said before and definitely not what we are talking about here. Sorry to emphasis that point like a broken record, but that needs to be made very clear.",

As has been observed lately by others and myself, KI lately has been doing a bit more work himself on the Saturday session. Something he used to sprinkle in but it has become a lot more regular. From my own perspective, the only thing I can say is that I have gone 6 weeks before without going to a park run - so that's 18 sessions all sub threshold with nothing above - and I still pb'd that week in the 5k. So if I had to guess, not much. But overall, it's probably something. I just wouldn't want to send someone down the garden path and say it's something it's not. Like you must do this or that on top of the sub threshold work. I think as I'm UK based, ParkRun is the perfect option - you get some work in once every few weeks and in general you are probably more motivated than you are alone. Plus it's free and for most people in towns and cities, there's one you can run out to and from and it costs nothing. I would stick to the general principle that the vast majority of the work that doesn't quantify as easy, remains sub threshold. I don't want to dig around too much into the weeds of throwing other things into the mix, when I still think just sticking to this will get you very close to the maximum gain, for a reduced number of hours - with relatively limited risk factor. Oh and well done Fusio, keep it going. Nice to see someone else having success and who has crossed over from cycling. I feel your pain, the weight loss is hard. I know I could speed up by just losing another 3-4kg. But I just can't shift it.",

    "message": "Ok, this thread seems to have a bit of life back in it. So let's talk about the easy run and power. So I've said before, I like pace. I live in a flat area and I'm looking at around 65% of MAS for these runs. This is for the 3x normal runs and the long run of the week. This will normally amount to around an average of 70% Max HR, probably slightly under. I totally concede, pace is not the best metric for some people. Living in the hills etc. So I bought a Stryd, as you can see a few pages back. Previously, I didn't have much luck. But I've persisted. I'm having trouble (or was) with the sub threshold stuff, but I feel I have some really good data to feedback for those interested on the easy runs. So I did 4x easy runs blind, I just did my usual pacing and noted down the results. Then on my 5th easy run today, I tried to run ONLY to power , I didn't look at anything else but aimed for average power of the 4 previous runs. The result? The pace of the run was a bit more up and down. However, the power curve was almost flat and the result a run bang on 65% of MAS on average for the 55 minute run and 68% of max HR. Incidentally, the HR was a lot flatter. Much flatter in fact, due more even power distribution. All 5 runs it turns out were within a few \"watts\" of each other (let's use watts like that, as it's not really watts). This was at 78% of my FTP. This seems to make total sense. In the stryd zones, this is the upper end of zone 1. Much like it would be for pace and HR. So all matches up very nicely. Now I'm not saying that is the case for EVERYONE. But I know there are some guys out there interested in using power . And if you have a pretty decent idea of your FTP, I would suggest 78% is a really good starting point. This resulted in the top end of the MAS suggestion, for the easy run. So let's say 78% is the cap and work down from there.",

    "message": "I really like the variety of approaches the thread is touching on in regard to quantifying effort/stimulus. Whether lactate, heart rate, pace, or power. It’s interesting to see how the various metrics align with training and race performance too. With regard to power, something that might be of interest to the group. The power model that Stryd uses, from what I can tell, is based on the sum of three power components. The primary values that contribute to the power level, specifically if power for air resistance and elevation are not a factor, are weight (kg), speed (m/s), and ECOR. ECOR stands for energy cost of running. Based on the data Stryd provides, they use a standard ECOR value of 1.04. So the simplified power equation looks like: Power = Speed*Weight*ECOR However, if you look at their data, it shows the better a runner you are, the lower your ECOR value. They list an elite runner as having an ECOR of 0.93, an average runner as 1.01, and an untrained runner as 1.06. If you change your ECOR value from 1.04 to 1.01 in the power formula, that leads to a 2.88% REDUCTION in power, assuming speed and weight hold constant. So for those of us looking to target power for workouts and races, who are “better” hobbyists, keep that in mind. Sirpoc has a good approach to go on feel and compare it to other metrics he uses. If you’re really into data, you can “fine tune” your ECOR value by observing it over the course of your sessions and calculating it yourself from the data. ECOR = Power / (Speed*Weight) If you want to use that data to get a more accurate race time prediction (assuming similar conditions as your workouts of course), based on a targeted power level: Time = (ECOR*Distance*Weight) / Power where Distance is in meters and Time in seconds Hope that’s insightful for the nerds on the thread. P.S. sirpoc, I like your idea of using the thread to crowd source data for more accurate training metrics over a span of devices/inputs. Lets make it happen LOL",

I'm way more of a hobbyjogger than most, recently PR'd with a 19:46 parkrun. I haven't had access to a lactate meter so I've erred on the side of caution and used the VDOT equivalent HM-FM paces for the workouts so far (5x5, 5x6, 8x4 minutes), HR has been creeping up to 90-92% of max by the last minute of the last rep so I'm reasonably happy with that even though the paces seem very slow for now (around 4:30/km). Will do a Friel test soon. One thing to note is that 65% of MAS and 70% of max HR for me are two completely different values - the former is a bit faster than I had been doing my easy runs prior to finding this thread and would push the HR closer to 80% of max. I tried the latter approach and was honestly shockingly slow, around 7:00/km or 11:00/mile, closer to 50% of MAS than to 65%. I'm definitely aerobically undertrained as my PR's get progressively worse as the distance increases (42:02 10k, 1:39 HM, 4:05 FM, though more recently I raced a 70:43 10mi and a 2:41:40 20mi which are still bad compared to the 5k/mile but definitely an improvement), not sure if that has something to do with it or if the body just needs to adapt to the new training load. Will try this out for a few weeks with no races (will do one 7k time trial just to get the Friel results and check my fitness levels) and race again in exactly a month's time to see the results. Thanks to spoc, shirtboy, Hard2Find and others who have contributed to outlining this approach.",

    "message": "Well done on your recent PB mate. Sub 20 is a nice milestone. There's plenty of hobby joggers who will never get there. Were you doing the easy runs based on MAS around 5:35/km? If so I have a friend who has been training like this (although now I think he's given up as he just went too hard on the sub threshold days). He was the same, his HR was pretty high - but we stuck to MAS and even after a few weeks it came down quite a lot on these runs. The other option is you don't know your true max HR, but I doubt that - it wouldn't account for most of the gap and also I'm usually at or very close to max HR at parkruns so I would imagine you are as well. This is why everything I posted up was a guide , I'm sure I'm boring everyone by keeping saying this - but what I posted was what I knew definitely fit neatly for me. Go to Tinman's calculator, plug in your 5k time and from memory his \"easy\" is a little big slower than MAS. I would stick to that range maybe for now. It's definitely not going to crush you and you will be able to do your workouts the next day - take HR even off the screen on your watch for a few weeks and then after 2-3 weeks have a look at how things have improved. Your intervals now seem like they are in a good range. Slightly slower than what I've been doing proportionally, but not by much tbh and as I've said before it's better to go a little bit slower , as there's still a reasonably big sub threshold window for you to catch and fall into. It does feel slow IMO. Especially if you have been doing park runs. It's significantly slower all the time than your regular \"race\" (park run isn't a race I hear you say ha ha) pace. But do that Friel test, then you can maybe stay where you are or Dial it up a notch . It'll give you more data and confidence in what you are doing.",

I wouldn't worry about it too much, like I say I think there's a good window sub threshold to hit within a pretty big range. In that fastest part of tinman tempo range after the last rep I've still seen 2.5 mmol on the longer ones. The Friel test is unpleasant for sure 😂. But if you are going to use HR it's a great way to do it. You can get a soft strap now pretty cheap and a lot of them are much better on the contact points than they used to be 10+ years ago. I don't even think that straps were great tbh. I used to get a lot of warm up spikes etc no matter what I did. Never have had a problem with even the newer, cheap ones.",

    "message": "Cheers! Annoyingly my HR strap hadn't connected at the parkrun where I set my PB but I'm fairly confident that my max is in the 198-202 range based on workouts/races/other sports (a tough 5-a-side or a 2k TT on the rowing machine feel like they're pretty much all out at some point) so I've been using 200 as an easy baseline for my mental maths. Like you said, even if it's a couple of beats higher in reality it still wouldn't change much. I'm gonna try running by feel and not worry too much about HR on the easy runs as they were definitely feeling comfortable in the 75% max range, nasal breathing, relaxed, didn't feel too beat up afterwards. Hopefully HR will come down, it already has as at the start of my hobby jogging journey I made the classic error of trying to hit certain paces on my 'easy' runs and my 5:40/km went from 82-85% to more like 75% since I stopped doing that. Based on my recent 10mi race my LT pace ought to be closer to 4:20 than 4:30 but like you said lactate testing is a bit cumbersome, I definitely wanna try it at some point but for now happy just getting into a consistent rhythm with these things and using HR as a proxy. It's also nice to not feel too beat up after the workouts, an unfamiliar feeling as I had been doing way more VO2 Max stuff with various running clubs. Maybe HRR plays into this as well? My resting heart rate is around 60 and I'm in the process of moving countries so stress levels/sleep probably worse than usual.",

    "message": "As I said before, pace seems to give you a higher TSS on the easier days, over HR. Whereas the sub threshold days, I'll get a slightly higher TSS score via HR, rather than pace. Overall they almost even themselves out. But STICK TO ONE METRIC. No matter what. Just pick whichever you prefer to train to and stick to it. Or you will have no clue whatsoever really what your CTL is consistently. The actual number it spits out, doesn't really mean anything to anyone but you. But FWIW, I have a CTL of about 61 right now via pace and about 60 it I recalculate via HR. But do not mix and match, if you want to make use of the PMC that's absolutely vital IMO. My experience is very in line with being able to index performance levels and fitness via the PMC, but only if you collect data properly. When it comes to power, it gets more complicated. For the easy runs, it will give you a TSS almost in line with Pace. But on the workouts, because NP is used to calculate, it will give you a much higher score for TSS than via HR or pace. Today's 10x1k for examples, was 88 TSS based on power, 79 for HR and 77 for pace. So overall, power will create a higher CTL in the long run. Again, it doesn't really matter. As long as you stick to power, as your metric. Again, this isn't of use to anyone, but yourself. But keep your own data consistent. A side note. My 5k at the TSS for the run was all within 2 of each other. I got 37 based on power, 36 for HR and 35 for Pace. So when the effort is very even and right on the limit, they clearly almost do the same job.",

I have been following this thread since day 1 and almost tried change my training straight off. I stagnate at 5k real bad. I was stuck in mode others have said so I tear up everything and try this. My PB was 20:20 for long time. I always run close to this maybe a year the last 15 times. Before my training was moderate runs, long run with some speed play , Daniels tempo style and some classic vo2 stuff. Maybe 400s. Sometimes hills, whatever different coaches provide me. Maybe 45 miles up to 50. Now for almost a month now I do what suggested on first page. 3x sub threshold. Feels so easy almost like it's a trick. Even easier than Daniels tempo for sure. So far I only do 9x1k around 15k pace and I do 5x7 mins at Hm pace or slower also feels quite easy and then I do maybe twice so far 3x3k somewhere between HM and M pace. Also feel easy. I think in total I have done maybe 11 sub T sessions now and not do anything else apart from easy runs including easy long. feel very slow. But I keep it up. Now last evening a big suprise, summer series 5k race. I did not feel good in warm up at all. Really bad in fact. But you know I was in total shock . I see my watch as I cross the line. 19:56. I thought must be big mistake. But I have run this race before it definitely true 5k course. Im very happy . Almost a year I have been trying with no success to get sub 20. I know not big for some people but for me I'm very happy 😊 Is this big suprise? Not even quite a month? I do not have training peaks or any other metrics but my Garmin is telling me training like this is increasing my overall train load. Before the line was flat.",

    "message": "Been watching this thread for a while. But I will bite . Clearly, you don't understand anything about this thread. 1. Nobody is claiming to be fast. I personally consider a low to mid 17 being pretty fast for a 40 year old hobby jogger with no running back ground. I'm a low 19 guy and I can only dream of a 17 of any sort. As far as I can tell from following the thread, he was running high 18ish for a long period of time whilst following what might be a classic running program whilst racing just as regular. The actual speed or pace of someone is totally irrelevant. What hobby joggers are looking for and the smart training is looking around to see what other people are doing they are giving the greatest relative improvement to previous performance. 2. Most people were probably having a long period of hitting a plateau for a while who have shared their experience in this thread. Nothing they were doing was improving them. This seemed to work in getting the balance right and maximising training load. 3. This isn't something made up. We've had numerous references and examples of how this has been applied to cycling or triathletes previously. Maybe this is an area where running is just catching up. I especially have learned something from home to use metrics such as TSS, CTL etc. and I definitely think I can now add them to make up the package of what I understand about my training. 4. All the resources and technology available to Kristoffer, the years of research etc the family has done yet he is training like this. King of the hobby joggers, whatever you want to call him. But do you honestly think that someone from the best running families around right now, he would train like this if it wasn't optimal for hobby joggers? 5. For what it's worth, I think the guy you are talking about will run a 15. In fact I would predict he will definitely. If you read the thread carefully about how it was applied to cycling, he mentions some times. As a tri guy his times are on the bike are bordering on true elite. So I fully expect if he stays injury free he will keep improving at least for the next 2+ years as he really adapts to running and run your 15:xx anyway.",

Although, it is interesting to construct your lactate curve and track it every 6 weeks, or so, over the course of a build up. The other benefit, is if you do want to target CS and other thresholds, it’s easy to do since most of them are referred to as a duration in minutes that you could race at. So, if you’re using your MAS/vVO2Max pace: 30 min (CS) = MAS/0.93 60 min (LT) = MAS/0.89 90 min = MAS/0.86 150 min = MAS/0.83 There are plenty of workouts you can come up with and perform in that pace range, specifically the 60-150 minute range, where you get in 30+ minutes of work and build that stimulus over the course of weeks and months. Like sirpoc, I’ve also observed that I usually don’t exceed 65% MAS on my easy runs. I’m sure there are people who can do that (probably the really fast guys popping up on this thread to tell us how much we suck haha), but I find that two tempo sessions and a long run with tempo work mixed in, “force” me to run very easy otherwise.",

    "message": "That's written a bit harshly, but it's true in the meantime. The term \"Norwegian approach\" alone is interpreted differently here and then as an all-powerful magic word, which is somehow laughable. From my point of view, there are two findings: 1. Who trains low mileage, should accommodate as much quality as possible. This includes threshold training, but not only. It's nonsense to think that all you need is just threshold in your low mileage schedule. 2. Who trains low mileage, does it consciously. You can and want to train much harder workouts than treshold, you want to minimize the risk of injury, you have problems with higher volume or you simply don't have time for much training. The classic threads titled \"Getting the most out of lower mileage\" and \"Real Low Mileage performers\" are the gold standard for low mileage fans. There's a lot of valuable stuff in there. Very interesting: Bruce Tulloh, time efficient running (4 days plan) and \"Bruce Tulloh on the truth about running\".",

That sweetspot is quite large under threshold, but it's also important to make sure you are in it, to get the absolute most out of our hobby jogger hours. Is it boring? Damn right. Is it cool? Definitely not. But running is not exactly cool in the first place is it lets be honest 😂😂 if you are a cyclist without a power meter, you are almost certainly at a huge disadvantage. I'm not saying we should be at these extremes, running should be more accessible - but you can gain an advantage at any sub elite or hobby jogger level I feel if you do work to maximise your training load. The whole point of this thread and then the vast amount of fantastic contributors towards it, is to make thinking hobby joggers can improve nearer to their maximum potential. I can only speak for me (although others have clearly shared their positive experiences) but worrying about all this has improved my 5k to level I quite happy with, having been at a point or stagnation that was really disappointing. If you offered most people a 7.5% improvement in performance over a year after the previous year or so of just maintaining,I think they would take it, no? Hobby jogger or not and yes even Parkrunners! I just wouldn't have got that increase in performance had I kept doing what I was doing - which was not worry too much and just follow the standard template, some tempo, some vo2, some moderate runs etc. So I think it matters. Maybe matters even make for the untalented than the elite, ironically. They will probably get to a higher % of their potential on talent alone. Us not so much.",

I recognize the limitations physiologists can face in regard to their research, but that is not data that warrants absolute conclusiveness, in a true scientific sense. If anything, I think it demonstrates how we should be more careful in assigning take away messages from research to apply in our training. I agree, there is interpretation on the range of percentages to use. Also, how you calculate them (i.e. “normal” math vs “Canova” math).

    "message": "@ a question please Let me first state in my response to your polite questions that this thread here, which I appreciate very much, does not clarify one fact. There is no question that most of us just can't reach the optimum with threshold/sub threshold alone. To me, typical low mileage is a weekly volume of 20-45 miles. At the latest from 50-60 miles the term \"low mileage\" loses its meaning. I would like to give an example. In the thread \"Getting the most out of lower mileage\" here at LRC a \"jerrry\" writes that he achieved his PR's (8k 23:45, 10k sub 30, 20k 1:03) as follows, quote: \"Sun - Long run day (usually after a race so a comfortable pace of 6:00 for 10-15 miles). Tues - Long tempo day (up to 12 miles) 5:30 or faster Thur - i call this my pre-meet workout - a short steady state of 3 miles (6:00, 5:40, 5:20) then 1 fast mile sub 4:30...then steady for another 2 miles to finish. Sat - race day (any where from 2M - 1/2 marathon).\" Besides a lot of threshold and sub-threshold, it's the weekly races and also the Thursday workout that have obviously helped him to achieve his lifetime PR's. Consciously he trained only 4 days/week to a) optimize recovery and b) minimize risk of injury and c) train exclusively all quality. This includes really fast stuff. That's the idea behind low mileage training. It may be that there are a few runners who reach their personal best without race pace stuff during the training, but that is statistically and training-scientifically not the majority and certainly not for distances under 5k.",

The whole point is to maximise the load, you are correct. In simple terms, I believe you can measure your overall training load/stress via a number of repeatable and consistent metrics . In pure simplistic terms - my finding as a general rule of thumb is that by creating the highest total training load via TSS, will result in increased fitness and performance. ( I've got quite in depth pages back that I have managed to index training load/CTL over time to my own performance ).This is from cycling mostly but now also running for me over the past year. KI is doing something very similar I believe. In this case, if you believe in this, there's less value in terms of classic 5k and below pace work. You can't do as much of it, it doesn't create as much load and in my experience you are more likely to get injured/tired/fatigued on these days. Whereas training at just below threshold, is pretty sustainable over a long period of time. Many people have mentioned the word boring here. It is very boring. So boring in fact, sometimes it's really hard to stick to it. But if you have the discipline, the benefits outweigh the negatives if your overall goal is to get faster.

I think overall if you are going to do 3x these sessions a week you don't want to be spending more than 30% time in zone over the week, absolute maximum on these, but that's literally pushing the limit and probs my living on the edge. That limits you at a max of 100 minutes. But 25% is more realistic. So it would be something like 4x7 mins at around 5:02-5:05 /km . You could then do 8x3.5 mins at around 15k pace or even a touch slower whilst you are getting used to it and then finish the week with 3x9 mins at around 5:06-5:09 /km. Rest just fill in the blanks for all easy running , no faster than about 6:25 /km. That really would be this system broken down into literally it's simplest form, without using any other equipment to measure anything. I hope that answers your question.",

You can't see a training unit isolated, as there was training before and will be after it. And there is periodization, an important point.

Also, the question of whether the successes of some here can't be explained simply by having trained with more consistency over a period of time doesn't matter. A core group of people here vote each other up and anyone down who doesn't write what they want to hear. How about actually lining up 10 people with a clearly defined program over 10 weeks for a specific competitive distance, training really low mileage and only threshold workouts? You then compare those to another group of 10 people doing another well-organized program? I suggest the FIRST program by Dr. Bill Pierce and Dr. Scott Murr, if anyone else knows that.

I’m only replying because I would never want to be associated with the claim that training at 100% vVO2Max is what I suggested. I think the judicious insertion of sessions at about 97% of vVO2Max (Daniels I pace) is definitely useful, I’ve said that. The majority of my workouts though are at about 94%-100% of Daniels T pace. I am a fan of his general approach. I just don’t adhere strictly to his T pace, more so run in the range of M pace to T pace for sessions. Which, if you read his second edition, he does include the idea that tempo runs in the 20-60 minute range slow from T pace to M pace as you approach 60 minutes.",

    "message": "I certainly have no idea what this thread is about at this point (haha), but I’ve enjoyed the exchange. I think sirpoc’s approach is probably what most people associate as the emphasis of this thread? There have been a few of us to suggest that if the Norwegian approach is just broadly considered more emphasis on a range of threshold paces for workouts, as opposed to just LT or the “traditional” approach of one LT and one VO2Max session per week, that has proved more sustainable and beneficial performance wise. Obviously, this is nothing novel, but I don’t think anyone has made that claim? I agree that unless carried out in a very controlled manner, it’s hard to know if our improvements come from specific changes in training versus the accumulation of training benefits from consistency, accrual over past seasons, maturation, etc. However, and I can only speak for myself, when I have shifted to a more traditional approach (one LT session and one VO2Max session per week), I see a drop off in performance and feel burned out. I personally would prefer the traditional approach, both for the aesthetic appeal of how it looks on the calendar and the variety in workouts. One long run, one tempo run, one interval session. That has a nice feel to it. However, it just hasn’t proven as beneficial for me as one long run and two tempo sessions at slower than LT, with the occasional VO2Max session, in general. Regarding your suggestion on studying responses to training, there has been no shortage of such studies in the research literature. Peter Snell, Olympic gold medalist, who is a physiologist performed a study where I believe the group of runners he used ran easy for 6 weeks and then split into two groups, one which ran two interval sessions per week consisting of 200m-400m for a total of about 4800m and another which ran two tempo runs per week of 30 minutes each. The other runs were all easy. They did this for 10 weeks. I can’t recall what the specific paces were, nor can I find the exact study to check it, but an 800m and 10km test were performed at the end of the easy running phase and then again at the end of the workout phase. At both the 800m and 10km, the interval trained group improved more on average. This was a surprise as tempo runs should have been more beneficial for the 10km. I remember reading this study and testing it on myself, although slightly modified. I did 6 weeks of just easy volume, 6*60 minutes and 1*90 minutes, then 6 weeks of two 30 minute tempos, then 6 weeks of two 15 minute intervals. During this experiment I maintained a 90 minute long run and 60 minutes easy on the other days. I did my time trials on the track and used a 1600m and 10,000m. I had the opposite result as Snell’s experiment, I ran both the 1600m and 10,000m slower after the intervals than I did after the tempos. Training and performance is quite the perplexing experiment haha",

Pretty much every study comes to the same conclusion as the snell study where intensity is better which is where the 90s less is more stuff came from. But they are all short term. You get a huge benefit from running at intensities that recruit all your fibers and get you used to running fast.

    "message": "Maybe I should give more context. Running 7.5 hours per week was a volume I was more than adapted to when I gave this a try. Summer is normally when I’ll play around with different approaches and structures, so that’s what I settled on out of curiosity. The initial 6 weeks of easy running was a way to equalize things, so to speak. Instead of going in with a huge base of mileage, I kept the hours constant to better assess the effectiveness. Plus, the volume is staying the same but the change in stimulus is coming from only the intensity of the two workout days and not from a shift in volume and intensity. Snell, I believe, had the runners maintain their volume as well. Whether or not he’d done that in his study, my intention was not to build a huge base and then cut volume significantly when doing intervals. I’ve tried that approach and the results were even more atroscious. Also I think you’re confused? I did do intervals, twice per week, that totaled 15 minutes per session. I used 10*1.5min and 5*3min. So, 6 weeks easy, 6 weeks with 2 tempo sessions, 6 weeks with 2 interval sessions. If I had done the intervals before the tempos, one could say, “Well the intervals helped the tempos and you still had the benefit of them when you ran your time trials.” In this scenario, since the intervals were considered to be superior to the tempos, the faster time trial results should have come after the intervals, not the tempos. Also, this was an interesting case of adhering to a strict linear periodization and seeing what happens. I think that’s pretty sound reasoning, not that I need to justify it haha",

    "message": "Hey jiggy. Would be really interested in this summary As it's something I have played around with. I've posted before about deliberately going over threshold, just so see if it would kill me 😂 obviously I didn't die ha ha but I did go about 7 seconds per km like you mentioned for the end of a 2k sessions and my lactate rocketed to well over 4+. I was otherwise in around the 2.5-3 ish range. What I really felt was it in my legs the next day, quite shockingly in fact for what was only a relatively short amount of time. The amount of fatigue is totally out of proportion to what seems like only a little bit of extra pace. It's why I agree 10 seconds here makes a huge amount of difference. Once you get up in that high ish range just under LT state, it's a real balancing act to make sure you stay in that zone. It's why as boring (yet again) I sound, I would much prefer someone to run slightly too slow and pace on the cautious side, that to push the limits where the risk reward just isn't worth it. Even if you lactate is only 2.0 mmol or just above as a random example , you are still going to be getting a huge amount and % of the benefit as if you are at say 3.3 mmol, to pick another arbitratory point as the example. But the issue is say you are regularly hitting the 4+ range. There's no way anyone could handle this 3x a week on maybe 7 hours like me, for almost a year. The 4+ might be giving you a a slightly higher TSS per session , but the value just isn't there if you can only do it twice a week instead of three times. I mean , maybe it's geeky or \"nerd it up\" as it was put. But, I mean, let's be honest running is probably one of the least cool sports out there, so, I mean who cares right? My feeling is despite being a true hobby jogger I may as well at least try and get the best out of myself.",

    "message": "Definitely interesting to see the results when you do a LT test, I agree. I’m with sirpoc, this is already a sport that attracts nerds and social misfits haha. Plus, this thread clearly loves data and detail, so why let those who disagree disrupt the content of our exchange. On that topic, and for those who say pace doesn’t matter (within a limit of course), look at a well plotted lactate curve where blood lactate is plotted as a function of speed. Take a small unit change in pace, say 5 seconds per kilometer, so just 2 seconds per 400m. When you’re well below LT1 you can make many unit increases and have little to no change in lactate, but then you reach that LT1 point and that same unit change leads to a large change in lactate. Get to that LT2 point (or slightly beyond) and that one unit change results in a massive spike in lactate. That is all happening in a relatively narrow window (LT1 to LT2) compared to the range of paces leading up to that threshold. The bioenergetics of what’s happening when you are in that range is very interesting and also, as sirpoc pointed out, quite delicate. You can literally pick up the pace by just 1-2 seconds per 400m and be imposing a much greater stress on your body, bioenergetically speaking, when you are at your LT2. Anyone who has had lactate testing done or uses/has used a meter would, I think, definitely have an appreciation for this, in the sense of relating the feeling to the numbers. It’s rather fascinating. As far as it changing how we train and what workouts to do, I think that’s up to the individual to use that information as they want. Some embrace it, some discard it. That’s life.",

    "message": "All I can do is share my experiences with you. It's hard to compare performance in running and Time Trialling, mainly because as an amateur it's much, much easier to get close to a pros level in a standalone race. In fact I've beaten and taken scalps of neo pros in a 10 in the UK on a bike. There's much more to the sport than JUST the aerobic fitness. I can probably gain a whole minute maybe more, on a pro just in a better position, better aero specific kit etc. The amateur, ironically, knows more about Time Trialling than the pro with good power who mostly just rides his road bike and doesn't care about TTs. So in this sense, you can't compare it. I'll always have been better on the bike, because of this. If you compare at the time, I was within a minute of the all time fastest 10 mile TT in the UK. Wiggins held the record at one point, a low 17. I'll never, ever get near the 5k equivalent, which is a sub 14 park run to get within a minute of the best. Literally never. I can't make up the gains in a sport that is almost based totally off your condition. Not equipment. It's funny, I was talking to shirtboy over email about shoes. It's peanuts in comparison to what you can gain via super shoes, versus the bike. Yet I'll still probably buy some 😂 Also my age. I'm nearly 40 now. Also the fact I'm fatter/heavier. Oh and also speaking to shirtboy who I now have on Strava, running a course that \"wasn't designed in a night at the pub\" would help. So maybe I could run sub 17 on another, faster course. But again, all these factors add up. If you look at my Aerobic actual fitness, both sports with very similar training have probably worked out as expected. In the sense they probably both get me very close to my maximum ability. Which I guess is all we care about? And I've tried stuff like 10x300. For me it's just not worth it. My legs are totally trashed after. It doesn't create much training load IMO and I'm affected still a few days later. Give me just being a pure strong aerobic guy any day without picking up the niggles and basically just leave the vo2 max stuff for the parkruns. I'm sure if I emigrated to a cold place and took up cross country skiing, or was a long track speed skater, I would STILL train this way.",

I have still seen lactate of 2 and slightly above mmol when I have tried longer reps (say 4x10 mins at the longest end depending on how much you do a week, but something like 4x 8-9 mins is fine) at marathon pace. This would usually gets me to within 85% max HR by the end and whilst it might be a bit slower pace wise, you still will get a huge amount of the training benefits in this range. This is the really good thing about training sub T, there's a window probably right down to where you are asking about in marathon pace, to collect a lot of the benefits. Which is why people doing doubles will often start the day with a session at somewhere around this pace to try and hit around this lactate. I think, that roughly matches up with Jiggys amazing post above. He's seeing 2+ lactate at around the end of his tests at around 85% Max HR which is about where I do or have in the past. I'm not sure what that equates to in terms of pace relative to himself or if that is around his marathon pace, maybe he could give us an idea. I would imagine the paces are just a guide for the individual, as I doubt his paces match up exactly to mine, but what I have seen no matter what , is how people's data all shoe the same. Pace really, really and I mean really does matter once you are hovering just below threshold. It gets out of control quick for what even seems like a small fraction of change in speed. I was helping a friend out recently who used to be a lot faster than me. He blew a lot of these workouts and got tired really quick. I would say right, today run 5x7 mins at HM pace + 2 seconds per KM and he would be like \"it was awesome! I felt amazing so the last two reps I was around hour pace!!\" As if I would be impressed. He just didn't listen that he was burning himself out really quick. Within a few weeks he was wrecked as he was doing stuff like this every session. The same on 10x1k would end up around 10k pace. Going back to Jiggys post, you can see quite quickly how much lactate would have been building up session on session towards the end, which, just isn't sustainable long term for 3x a week.",

I don't use either the avg HR, nor the max HR during a ramp protocol, i use the avg HR of the last minute of a ramp based on experience, because HR needs some time to settle, and one single HR spike is not of interest, which would influence a max level. I full agree with other posters that the intensity matters. It is not the same to train at 2mmoler or 4mmoler as an example. I just had a 8 week training period, were i did easy and so called sweetspot Q sessions (around 90%FTP, 2x/week, around 85%CV) on the bike, resulting in lactate levels of 2.5-3.0mmol. After 8 weeks i had improvement on higher power numbers, and a small improvement on the easy power output. My resume is that the Q sessions were too easy for me (fast twitcher).",

Rarely faster and definitely not for long durations. I did a few 400's sessions outdoors with 30 second rest in which I went faster than my HM pace (but also slower at times, due to the harsh humid summer I'm in). Moreover, I went ahead and did my first VO2 Max work yesterday, after not having done any such work since March. I wanted to do so for two reasons: 1) Sharpen up for a local 5K that I might do next week. 2) Test the system and just introduce some variety to the stress stimulus I've been subjecting myself to. So I set out to run a classic 5x1K in the evening. It is still very hot over here, but was not overly humid. It was 32.8 degrees Celsius with a relative humidity of 56% yielding a real feel of only 38.3 degrees Celsius (I say only because we can get days with a real feel of 50-55 degrees Celsius, so yeah). Having woken up with a somehow tight chest and given the conditions, I thought I'd be satisfied with hitting 3:30/km pace, or anything around that. I split the first rep in 3:20.3, and just started laughing out loud just as I did when I watched Jakob waving to the crowd during the semi final the other day. That first rep felt incredibly easy that I thought there must be something wrong. After a 400m jog recovery, I continued. Well here are the splits for the second, third and fourth kilometers: 3:21.5 3:22.1 3:23.9 Things did get tough for the last reps, and I mentally quit on the fifth last rep after 0.5 km which was also at 3:21/km pace. HR maxed out at 198 bpm which is 98% of Max HR for me. It was hot, I was solo, I had done weight training and 4 km easy in the morning before work, and I still managed to run faster than I used to during the winter when I had company for some of the workouts. Sure, I have been running more mileage lately, but that can't be the sole reason behind this. There's something to running these controlled sub threshold efforts. On we go.",

I'm not particularly fast, but I do believe what I'm getting the best out of what I've got. That's in terms of I have a life, a job, responsibilities and also not wanting to get injured. The reason I'm confident it works is I've followed more traditional training plans , absolutely exactly as they were laid out. For about the same time a week. I wasn't faster at all and didn't seem to improve past a certain point and didn't really feel like I was ever fresh or ready for any of the workouts. I'm guessing you will never try this, but I think the main thing that would shock people is how this doesn't feel particularly hard week after week or month after month. There's no killing yourself sessions, there's no session you dread. The main issue you will encounter is maybe boredom or the urge to actually go faster. That is probably the biggest issue I see people running into. For what it's worth, I trained like this for cycling for a while. Often with some quizzed looks when I told people or chatted to them after races. But now you will find sub threshold or sweetspot added even as a separate zone when you use FTP calculators and it's much more mainstream and widely accepted that it's a very good way to train for time crunched people. Will it be for running? Who knows. Running is a very odd sport in the fact it seems very much how someone described it a few pages back, in the sense coaches tend to prescribe what they prescribe, just because that's how it's \"done\". If you said to someone 30 years ago cycling would be a metrics driven sport, people would have laughed and said that's for the geeks like Chris Boardman training with his funny gadget, the power meter. 30 years on, if you aren't training with an understanding of metrics and training loads , you are not competing.",

    "message": "IMO the training load/CTL and TSS gets to the heart of why this works. Whilst those metrics are far from perfect, as I've explained I feel like they offer a lot and I still don't think there has been anything, to date, better to replace it. I also am firm in believing still as long as you collate and collect data accurately with regards to current fitness, you can index your own personal CTL to your current fitness. The data isn't transferable in any meaningful form to say \"person A is faster than person B, because person A has a higher CTL\". As in, if my CTL is 50 (To pick a number) - if I can get it to 51 I'll likely be fitter and probably faster in a 5k. If I can get it to 54, I'll almost certainly be faster. For someone else, their CTL might only be 40 to run the same 5k time as me. But again, relative to themselves, if they can get their CTL to 45, they'll almost certainly be faster. To get higher, you have to do some more work, relative to the sliding scale of what you have done previously in your training. So , for me, in simplistic terms, this makes total sense. Whilst there are some flaws and gaps in how an individual session for TSS is calculated, the good news I feel is that it seems to work very well, around this sweetspot level. This is again something I have picked up from cycling. I do feel like it probably underestimates a bit if you go by pace or HR, for the really hard running sessions, hills, vo2 max etc. That's the disadvantage of not having power. As per your example. Let's take a basic 7 hour week and that fits pretty neatly. Let's use rough numbers (they aren't exact) but give a good ball park. Runner 1 (you) 3 moderate runs of 50-55 ish mins 60 TSS per session. = 180 TSS 1 Daniels tempo half hour with warm up and down. 70TSS 1 easy active recovery run of say 40-45 mins. 30 TSS. 1 long run 80 mins. Easy 75 TSS. 8X800 around 5k pace with warm up and down. Around 60 TSS. That gives you around 415 TSS for a week. Runner B (me, this was literally my last week to use a real example) 3x 55 mins top end of easy around 52 TSS per run. 156 TSS 3x sub threshold runs around an hour with 35-36 minutes work + warm up and down 75 TSS per run. 225 TSS. Long Run easy 75 mins . 73 TSS. 454 TSS for the week. Whilst that doesn't sound like much difference, over time it will create a reasonably difference in overall training load. Probably enough to account for that differences in the 5ks I've set, for about the same amount of hours a week training. From a personal standpoint, also not having to run the Daniels straight tempo or especially the vo2 max stuff, also keeps me feeling fresher and less beat up in the legs. So the advantage is two fold.",

    "message": "This continues to be an interesting and thought provoking thread. I’ve enjoyed the serious discussion as well as the scattered troll insults. Some pretty clever ones a few pages back. Some additional thoughts: - We should keep in mind that “low volume” is basically the antithesis of the “Norwegian training philosophy”. Their goal is to train as much as possible. This applies to Jakob, the triathletes, and even Karsten Warholm. As Sirpoc writes though, this 3x per week threshold method does allow for about as much training as an adult with a family/job can handle. - On that note, if the goal is to improve, your goal should be to always be doing more. It is about what you can consistently sustain, so the progression will be extremely slow. One way to think about it: over a few months it might look like you aren’t progressing or changing the training at all, but look a year later and you should see a difference. - In running, as you hit high speeds the load on the muscles/tendons is exponentially higher. I recently tried to add a hill day as my 3rd workout and a few weeks later ended up with an achilles injury. I think that as you get older, the impact of high intensity workouts on recovery is greater. And I think Jakob thinks the same thing — this is why he says it is harder to be good at 1500 compared to 5k at older age. - For those commenting that you can’t race a good 5k without ever running fast in training: first, note that Sirpoc is running a lot of 5k races. My personal experience is that it can be a little hard to push myself after a few months of this training (only did it once). Recently, I did a 5k and in the lead up did a workout where I’d do 5 x 1k, starting at the usual mile repeat threshold pace with 1 minute rest, and after the first 2 reps, increased the pace to the 3k-5k pace range, extending the rest before 3rd/4th/5th rep. I felt that it helped me to work into the pace (being not used to it), but also prepare to hit the slightly higher lactate levels. I’ll probably use that again in the future (when the achilles is better). Some observations from KI strava: - It is remarkable how much volume a person can progress to doing on this system. KI is doing 36-42k of work per week at this reasonably high intensity. That is massive. Note how he is constantly doing more. Anyone who says Jakob is just doing 2x 10k threshold sessions on Tues/Thurs is forgetting that the main principle is to always do more. There is no way he is doing the same volume as he did a few years ago. (Nordas implied this in an interview as well) - The focus seems to be on the pace, much more than the exact lactate. It seems like he checks lactate at the end to calibrate where he is, and also to decide what to do next session. But the pace is very tightly controlled (he even uses wave light, which is remarkable in my mind). - He ran a 10k at 3:20 pace back when he never went below 3:30 on any intervals. Race pace may be over rated. - When he was first making his massive improvements, his interval pace was actually slower than the HM paces he eventually would hit. This was even for 1k-2k reps. And back then he typically would just run the same pace for 1k, 2k, 3k reps. Now he seems to adjust more, but I thought that was interesting. - They pay attention to everything to ensure progress. I believe he previously was running easy days a bit faster (7:20/mile or like 4:35/k), but now is more often closer to 8:00/mile or 5min/k pace. He tried a period of slightly lower volume of shorter, faster reps (10x1k) but felt banged up and didn’t improve much, so reverted to 12+k of longer reps. Initially long runs were shorter but in the last several months has started doing ~2 hours or 26k long runs. - While the training started at about 1 hour per day, he’s doing quite a bit more than that now. So us (likely less talented) regular hobby joggers should not expect indefinite improvements if we aren’t also gradually progressing the training volume. - People reference Tinman a lot on this thread. He did seem to have some understanding of this, but I’ve recently been thinking how it is crazy that a hobby jogger like KI can be training at what seems like significantly higher training stress than a Tinman athlete like Drew Hunter. I know Drew is no longer with Tinman, but workouts like 8 x 1k + some 200s seem somewhat unimpressive when KI is doing 14 x 1k on a Saturday. Makes you wonder if Drew was coached by Gjert how much better he would have been. Well that was quite the novel. I guess I’ve been thinking about this a lot.",

You get fitter , simply because this seems to be the highest range of lactate you can reach pretty much every other day without fatigue setting in. I'm on about a year straight of this with a tiny break got COVID in between and running every day. I know some people like the idea of a day off. But I feel worse when I do so just have got used to running everyday. I think this is highly individual. Listen to your body. If you really know you can't run everyday, don't. It's also convenient for me, I can pretty much so the same stuff, on the same days per week to fit it into my lifestyle. I've also noticed as pointed out above , KI has really ramped it up. He's still on singles and the same system basically, just pushing the envelope. The really long runs and stuff like 14x1k maybe suggests he's training for a marathon? Something longer than the half he was training for before? There's quite often some comments in the chat under his runs , but it's usually in Norwegian. The lack have race pace has never ever worried me. As I've said many times, I was training on the bike for years and I never did any race paced specific stuff for Time Trialling and this was never a problem. I've seen zero issues either at working like this and suddenly 5k pace being a problem or a shock if I've gone a month or even more with no parking.",

    "message": "One of the aspects of HADDs method that I think is useful is that you increase the HR of your long tempos as you get fitter. In theory once you can do 10 miles or 60 minutes at a consistent pace and HR you bump the HR up, eventually progressing to your \"Marathon HR\" as he defines it. His ex. is about 175 BPM for a best potential Marathon HR, if your Max HR is 193, this would mean initially doing your long tempos at 160 BPM, progressing to 165, 170, and finally 175 as you can handle it. (I topped out at 50 minutes so i never even touched this aspect of the training) Specific Details of HADD aside, I wonder if a similar progression should be recommended for those transitioning to the Hobby Jogger Norge approach. Instead of trying to start by running at or just below your LT from the get-go, start even further below that until you're acclimated, then progress gradually toward that LT line. The HADD training also begs some other questions. How do the effects of broken intervals at just Sub-T compare to longer continuous tempos at Sub-Sub-T? Also Crazy to think he has people progress to 10-mile tempos at LTHR, when we're fighting to do much lower volumes in broke intervals. Seems impossible.",

One plots training stress, using points, as a function of %vVO2Max. The other plots the percent you recover from an interval as a function of time. Both are indeed non-linear (exponential and logarithmic, approximately, respectively). I’ve referenced this before, but Daniels has a point system in his second edition. Same as Tinman, if you plot the training stress as %VO2Max, you see an exponential relationship. Daniels has a lot of really insightful information beyond E, M, T, I, and R pace. I was thinking to create a document with all the “technical” aspects (equations, charts, tables, analytical methods examples) of what we have been talking about, but wasn’t sure if that would be of interest? Similarly, since TSS and CTL seem to be popular amongst the group. I did create an equivalent plot/equation as the one Tinman and Daniels have, to compare. Again, it plots the training stress (points per minute) as a function of the Intensity Factor you are running at. I found that while the TSS is not linear, it doesn’t have quite an exponential form either. So, as you progress from slower to faster speeds, the stress value it is assigning doesn’t increase as rapidly as with Daniels’ and Tinman’s model. Just some more fun with data I thought the group may find interesting haha",

What he said certainly made sense from a practical standpoint in the lectures, just wish i had a function to go along with it! The % of Vo2max seems to make the most sense in running and like you said, VO2 max and HR are trending up, but VO2 is certainly an exponential function.

HR is just useless for those reps anyway but pace I'm guessing must be calculated in a linear fashion? It's past my understanding. Despite my posts I'm very much not mathamatic or scientific in my background. The good thing about sessions on the bike back in the day for me was you could account for the harder work better due to normalised power. Yes, you would get some weird anomalies, in the sense that there was some NP buster sessions , that didn't make sense (you could score over 100tss per hour) but as I said before, over the long term looking at 6-12 months training, I made really good use of it to index it to performance. This is an area I've also seen Coggan trigger many people or be triggered by Coggan on the old forums I was on.",

But you can see from his HR for the reps it's way above threshold. Maybe he's been reading this thread because I've been talking about 6x1600 a lot ha ha and I've never seen him do that before. One thing I will say, I've seen him do random sessions before, like one week he did 1x10k steady for no real apparent reason. I thought maybe he had a 10k coming up soon and was throwing out a 95% effort or something. He tricks you into thinking he's changing the whole thing up then he's back to 3-4x3k or 5-6x2k for weeks on end. Maybe he's been doing it so long now, sometimes he just wants to mix it up as it can be really mundane. I sometimes get that feeling.",

That seems to roughly scale down on say 40mpw with the shorter seesion you listed to compliment the two longer sessions. I'm guessing on 40 that the long run is pretty long? I would turn that into an easy long. Add in another easy for 6 days if you can , then you probably wont be far off and you can slowly up it. I started off with less hours/ mileage and 10x3 was my shorter session, that has now become 10x1k for about an extra 5-6 minutes. I made that bigger by increasing my overall hours a week, then with the 25% in mind proportionally adding on 5 mins of sun threshold time when I've added on 15 mins more easy time across the week. Exactly the same , 5x6 became 5x2k, again for around an extra 5-6 mins. In the end, like any system, you'll need to do something to get fitter. But I feel with this you can just slowly up it. Again, KI Strava is great if you have time. Have a look back right to the start and how he's really slowly added on just a few minutes here and there weekly , slowly. This is where (I'm sure everyone is bored of this) CTL is great. As again, if you keep all your zone metrics updated, you can see when your CTL is stopping to increase - or at least flattening off, and then you can look at where or how you can up it ever so slightly. This is where my experience at training like this helps, I'm confident in following that - knowing it will work over years and years outside of running. There will be a point I literally don't have time to increase load anymore, I'm probably close to being there, which is where the PBs will stop and I'll have to have a rethink.",

I don't think they made a big difference, but I had to make it clear that there was running faster than threshold. It wasn't much and it was not recent (i.e. last few weeks), but it was there.

So I'll be a little disappointed if I don't go sub 1 hour. That's the target anyway. For what it's worth, when competitive on the time Trialling scene, I never ever changed my training no matter what the distance . This is despite competing in both 10, 25 and 50s. Roughly the equivalent of 5k, 10k and HM in terms of time/duration. I seemed to be pretty equal at all distances, despite most of my training near my peak being stuff like 3x15 or 20 sweetspot. This would probably be in terms of running, around half to marathon pace, looking back at HR curves and plots etc. The obvious advantage on the bike is the lesser impact, so you can get away with doing slightly more.

Yes, maybe it's geeky and nerdy as people or trolls have pointed out. However, I'm a firm believer that just because I've been successful in the sport for 40 years and competed just an an elite international level, it doesn't mean I know everything. In fact in all honesty, reading some of the sports crossover here and how things could have been done, I'm actually kicking myself that maybe I didn't reach my full potential looking back at things I did, or didn't do. Someone else mentioned it before pages back, but in my opinion it's not necessarily the guys who are fastest you want to copy. Fast is fast. I know guys who could run sub 14 on almost any cobbled together plan. It's the guys with limited time or ability who perform above themselves, when you are looking at it as a hobbyist activity.

You need to build your base and get mileage up a bit, then you can make use of their method. Here's a good way to do it: On Tuesday, do a single thresh session. Making this a continuous session like a fartlek is wise. Thursday, run a tempo or progression run. It'll be a tick easier than thresh but still a good quality day. Saturday, do another thresh session, perhaps some track reps this time. After some time maintaining this model, you can increase mileage by introducing doubles on your easy days. Doing a 6-7 mile run in the morning and a 5-6 mile run in the evening is a great approach. At some point (when you feel ready for it) you can switch the Thursday progression run/tempo a progression long run. Once you're sustaining 65 miles per week or so on this model, you can start throwing in a second threshold session on Tuesday, and if you want, an easy long run on Sunday. That training model will come in at 65-75 miles per week. About six months past that point, provided you've stayed healthy, you'll be ready to implement the full Norwegian model at 85-95 miles per week and you'll be a completely different runner than you are today.",

I'm not sure if this means anything, but my last 5k was a TSS of 35-37 range, depending on if you go by pace, power or hrTSS. TRIMP was 60. My last 10x1k session the week after that, TSS for the entire session was 75 based on Pace, 79 based on power or 76 based on HR. TRIMP was 120. So any form of TSS is just over double for an average training session for me, compared to a 5k . Whereas TRIMP is exactly double comparing the two. So long term there's probably not much difference in using any of these. I'm just all in favour of picking any metric you like and just collecting the data accurately. As in, making sure you update paces, HR zones, power etc to your latest fitness, on a regular basis. I think if you do this, whether it be TSS in all 3 forms we have talked about here, or TRIMP, you will learn something from your own training and fitness. As I've said before, it's only really useful for yourself. Just because my training load metric is higher than someone else, doesn't mean anything. It's worth nothing. But as long as you are collecting your own data accurately, over months and years - I have a very good idea of what my \"60\" or whatever it is, is worth, to my own fitness. My PBs in both sports I've spoken about, all sit at the absolute top end of my highest CTL training value, no matter how I got there. I'm only proposing this training as I believe it's the quickest, safest way to get to that highest training load point, for a hobby jogger.

TSB in that period ranges from -1 to about -8. Obviously you have to do more, to ramp up your CTL. One thing I've been very good over the years is how to increase the load very slowly, almost so it's unnoticeable in terms of impact on the body, but as the weeks and months go on you will see small performance increases. I was always good at that on the bike and really feel like this experience is paying off now running, hence this system working perfectly for me as it's so easy just to ramp it up here and there. For example I had a few weeks where I went from 425 TSS for the week, the next week I'll aim for 428, maybe 432 the week after and so on. Broken record incoming again, but these numbers only mean something to yourself and are then only useful to yourself if you are constantly updating zones etc to current fitness. Complete side note. I raced the national 25 time trial champs in 2016, with the idea of going in fresh and targeting top 10 overall which was incredibly realistic based on my results. Tried to get my TSB/form into the green and fresh which I did. I can't even remember why I did this in retrospect. Probably the most horrible ride I ever did, thought the power meter was broken . Realised it wasn't when I saw the results and came about 37th. Honestly, probably the worst I've ever done in either sport, based on what I should have done. Ever since then I've totally not worried about or really paid much attention to my TSB. I did get it to -30 or maybe more I think once and did feel pretty terrible but it passed, as an extreme. I think that was in a January after I had taken my usual winter off and had got fat .",

    "message": "Yep spot on. As per my non running example, my only real attempt at a taper ended in total disaster. Some of the smarter guys here may well have an idea of why that is case. But I've also seen it with other time crunched cyclists, in particular. They go best when they just continue to do , what they are doing. Maybe it's because the overall load isn't actually that high, compared to an elite. As for your other point, exactly that. I'm adding bits on here and there. For example, I've added some time onto my easy runs. This has got me over by a few minutes the 7 hour mark. That has allowed me to do the full compliment then of the sub threshold sessions. One I limited to 30 minutes in total. But now all are around 35-36 minutes. It doesn't sound like much, but over time, weeks, it slowly ramps things up. This is another reason I train everyday and rarely take a day off. I'm limited to about 7 hours really in my life and honestly this is just about the best way to fit it in. A 75 mins \"long \" run and now hovering around 55-60 mins on all the other days. Either easy or Sub threshold. I'm thinking about keeping to push and could I get up to 8 hours a week. I think it would increase my pretty average running potential, but it would mean probably some days having to run before work to fit it in long term. Plus it's been easy ramping it up this summer, nice weather etc. Even 7 hours seems quite daunting when the UK cold, rain and darkness sets in. We will see. Pushing my CTL beyond where it is now I think is tricky.",

Ok - there aren't many coaches prescribing 3 threshold sessions a week with no VO2 stuff. No books written about it with thousands of success stories. But evidence has been drawn here from various sources (elite Norwegian training, concepts from academic papers, established cycling training methods, CTL, anecdotal reports) to form a pretty compelling logical approach. It is still unproven, in my opinion, but the concept is coherent enough to give it a crack and see what happens. If you disagree, fair enough. No one is forcing you to do it. I would be very interested to see someone actually attempt to dismantle some of the assumptions made to construct the 'hobby jogger threshold' system.

You know the usual. The sub threshold way creates a greater training load a week, hence why I believe it works. You can simply do more in the quality zone. I spoke about this right near the start I think, will be on an early page. But basically, my CTL was capped on the previous approach, I just couldn't get it any higher in the time I had. Until I started pushing the envelope to as much load as I could handle every other day, whilst still recovering. FWIW yes, there's more minutes of quality making the difference. But that's only because there is no vo2 max to recovery from, apart from the parkruns.

    "message": "Yes. So basically, when I see a new high point or CTL peak, I know there's a very good chance I'll probably PB. Example, I was talking about my CTL a day or so ago. I noticed last night it had crept up to 63. New highest point. I had been speaking to shirtboy over email and said I was feeling good lately (although not that feeling in my experience can tell you much, I can feel good and go not so great - or vice versa), so might do a parkrun this week; I saw that 63 and thought definitely will have a very good chance at a PB to actually back up feeling good, so got up and went out this morning. I ran 17:15 today, so I am very happy with that, another solid PB and earned my beers tonight. This again matches up to a new high running CTL. For what it's worth, when I was stagnating, my CTL was stuck around the same number and it wasn't until I really made a dramatic shift in the sessions I was doing (the shift from a more standard running approach to this) that I could raise it some more and then get back to taking some time off my PB again. Hopefully people see it's the mixture of the subthreshold sessions making it much easier to raise my training load, it's not that I'm claiming subthreshold are miracle sessions. They most likely will just get everyone to a higher training load quicker, or more importantly, higher for the same amount of time dedicated. Also, yes. I can plot just about any PB back over time , to high CTL peaks. Again, in reverse, most downturns in performance and be traced back to a lowering CTL, for a number of reasons, based on crashes on the bike or just reduced time to train and life getting in the way, or even just being bored and or life taking my eye of the focus of training. Or the third point of indexing, the point of stagnation, where I had basically maxed out the training load I could do on the hours I was doing in running originally, with the more classic training approach, and my CTL was basically staying the same. This is where you have to understand how it works, to manage it and to incrementally increase it, to improve performance again. As to your third point, I agree. Most people probably aren't understanding how fine tuned it all is and broadly entering their zones or not updating them correctly, so it's hard for them to see or understand these patterns in their own data and training. As I have a decided to use pace (as it works best for me living in a pan flat area)when you get a new PB, you obviously must update your zones etc. As now to create the new TSS, you'll obviously have to work a little bit harder than previously. For example, your estimated 15k pace to use for the 10x1k session, will now be faster. If I didn't make sure everything was updated, I'd either be given a higher TSS score for running faster, or the same TSS score for running the same speed, but in relative terms it was actually easier. This is a basic example, but where , believe it or not, a lot of people mess up. This thread is pretty funny, I'm kind of shocked it's still going and being active. I think on the whole most people have found it of good use? I also love the fact that other runners , take the time to come onto the internet and anonymously call the people who to contribute to this thread geeks 🤣 for a start, all runners are pretty geeky. I mean none of this puts us in the cool club, right? Whether it be that we train like this and look at the fine details, or just run. It's all pretty niche and nerdy either way. Here in the UK running is pretty much as un cool a a hobby you can get. So if I'm going to do something already on the nerd spectrum, I may as well get the best out of it.",

    "message": "For reference, I'm 72in/183cm and 150lbs/68kg. My experience living in a warm climate is that during summer, when temps are around 80F/27C, that slows my pace by roughly 16 seconds per mile or 10 seconds per km (probably even more if it's a long effort), compared to when temps are about 60F/16C. This totally depends on the workout though. If it's short repeats like 200m-400m, the impact is minimal versus a tempo run (which I don't even attempt during the summer). There are models which estimate the impact of temperature on performance. Also ones for weight loss/gain. My experience running my numbers through those is that they are similar to using 220 minus age for calculating your max heart rate... not very accurate haha I'll state the obvious and say, in general, if you can run in a good climate and run faster, that's preferable to running slower, in a less ideal climate. Heat impacts fatigue a lot more too than equations estimate, I think. Less volume at a slower pace in a less ideal environment leaves me more fatigued overall than more volume at a faster pace in a more ideal environment.",

So for me you do 3Q+ 4E/week. - 35minutes sub CV is most likely more than enough, because you are close below CV (pace you can hold for about 25-30minutes). For a higher volume, the intensity should be possible reduced. However this would trigger different muscle fibers and result in different lactate levels and adaptation. Therefore, for a higher volume, a double threshold might be possible a better solution. A rest day/week and a really long run might bring an even better result. (?) I also agree with others that with your 7day-3Q/week training, an overtraining/overuse is likely in the future, because the body can't handle an increase and increase and increase all the time. But i wish you i am wrong, but my 40 years of athletic experience tells me otherwise.",

I’m using intervals.icu to monitor my training. Great free resource btw. :) I’m using pace to calculate my fitness/CTL. A the moment my threshold pace is set at 4:11/km and I’m using the Friels 7 zone system. As I understand it’s crucial that you update your zones for it to work correctly when monitoring training load over time. Let’s say I run a 19:00 5km next week what calculator would you then use to get my new threshold speed estimate that I then can update my intervals ICU zones with?

If you used different threshold pace estimates, they might be a couple seconds per km out. But in general, just use the same one you used before, by entering your new pb into the same calculator. That way, it'll keep your numbers consistent proportionally to your new fitness. Daniels is fine. Tinman is fine. Just use which ever threshold calculation you started with to get to your 4:11 /km .At the end of the day it's a jumping off point for the calculations, just keep how you get to that threshold jumping off point the same each time. As far as I know, it doesn't matter what one of the zone systems you use, it's all based on an internal % of threshold within ICU. In terms of I mean, if you use runcoach zones, Friels, 80/20, makes no difference to your actual TSS score. But will change how it displays \"time in zone\" over the week. Again, just pick/keep which one you prefer. Once you have set up how to calculate your threshold and which zones to use, stick with it. Or your data won't make sense. The data is only useful for you anyway. You can't compare it to mine, or the next person. As you might run 17:15 off 40 TSS and it takes me 63.

    "message": "Completely agree Lexel . My long run isn't long really. Which is why I put it in quotation marks. Maybe that part it's lost in translation. I'm certainly not calling it long. Its long simply in the sense it's my longest run in the week but it's very much easy. Totally agree this is an easy run in fact I aim for exactly the same pace and will result in a low HR as I do on all my other easy runs. It's totally included in the 75% of running which is, IMO, incredibly easy and not a quality workout. I am curious if you think it's running of why I'll get injured? This is my third summer running now and the best I have felt. The worst I felt and picked up some injuries was early last summer which made me change. The vo2 work was crushing me. I felt so bad on the days after it I almost quit. I just couldn't get myself going, hit a brick wall and my performance was just not moving in the right direction. I guess any runner is worried about injury. I did this same system on the bike for more years than I care to remember, over training was never an issue and of course injury chance is basically zero (except impact injuries from crashes I had in races). But my goodness, sometimes I even did 4 times a week 3x20-25 mins sub threshold/sweetspot on the bike. Never felt tired in the slightest. You just recover too fast , for it to grind you down IMO. If I was running right around threshold or above, I'd agree. I'd be crushed. But my lactate and HR is in a zone I know I can handle as long as I don't push it - and be ready to go again after an easy run the next day. But not pushing it is the absolute hardest part and the reason most people don't stick to this. I have almost religiously stuck to this for over a year now. I missed maybe 4 days in all that time, when I had Covid. Otherwise I would have had zero days off. Kristoffer even longer I think just doing the same thing, with only ever so slowly changing little bits here or there.",

These are roughly rounded TSS numbers I've seen for me in the last few days. Me on 7 days Workout 76 TSS. Let's say roughly all going to be the same and just call it 75. 225 TSS via workouts for 3 times a week. 3 easy runs all at 50 TSS for 150 TSS and a \"long run\" for 75 TSS (let's just call if that for 1 TSS score a min to keep it really simple, even though I actually went 80 mins this week) . 450 TSS for the week. This is pretty much this week ( I did a park run, but let's just pretend that was a workout, and for arguments sake, the race + running there and back, weirdly just happens to equal about 75 tss anyway) Me on 6 days but one quite a bit longer run. 2 workouts. Let's say I go a bit harder, I probably could on two. 80 tss per session. 160 tss. The same easy runs, 150 TSS. nothing changes here. Then instead of 75 TSS for the long run, let's say I really push it. I could manage 105 minutes I think. So let's give myself 105 TSS. You have to remember though, this would need to be kept reasonable in terms of time, as to score the 1 TSS (roughly a minute) I would need to be going the same pace I did for 75 mins . But I managed it in theory, so I get 105 TSS. But I think that's generous, because I feel in reality I would have to dial that pace in a slight bit. But being the most generous I can, I only score 415 TSS for the week. All my experience (mostly from cycling but I'm starting to have a year's worth of running data showing the same patterns), is that I'll almost certainly be faster with 7 days and just scoring as much TSS as I can and gaining a higher CTL. Plus as I've said before it just fits in neater to the week. I would be perfectly happy with doing a slower, longer run on day 7 for more TSS as well as running the other days 3 on and 3 off, for slightly more TSS, if I could. A bit like Kristoffer is doing now. But, quite frankly, it's hard to fit in to a time crunched life.",

    "message": "Yes, correct. Runner 2 is the runner using sirpoc’s general outline and does maintain a higher CTL over the course of the training period. As sirpoc has pointed out (and perhaps I should've emphasized this in the documents), your TSS and CTL can be compared if running relatively the same amount of hours per week. The comparison would be at what average intensity factor. However, if the comparison is between two different runners (as opposed to the same runner comparing the two different training approaches), one runner may be able to run a 15:40 5k with a peak CTL of 56 where as the other runner may run 17:30 with the same CTL. So, to clarify, I’m presenting these simulations as the same runner who is debating which approach to take as opposed to, “Method 2 yields a higher CTL so that means Noel will run faster than Liam, since he uses method 2.” As far as increasing the stimulus on the workout days, you either run more volume at the same intensity factor or run the same volume at a higher intensity factor. The choice is really up to the runner, what they are training for, what is motivating for them, etc. I like two longer threshold workouts and a long run where you incorporate some fartlek or threshold. I race mainly half marathons and marathons though, so find a solid long run more foundational. It still amounts to 3 threshold efforts and 3-4 easy days for the week. As Marco Pierre White would say, “It’s your choice, really.” By the way, I’m a fan of regular strides too. I’ve heard Keith Brantley refer to them as pushups for your legs haha",

Fwiw, I agree with Coggan that is a great tool and incredibly useful, but only in a case study of 1 and where you are carefully handling and managing the data to make sure it's as accurate as can be. Which the article I can remember was. It also goes into why they used pace TSS, over TRIMP. Like I've said before and you've pointed out, whilst it sounds obvious a lot of people simply dismiss it as rubbish because they are like \"well Noel is faster than me but his CTL is 35 and mine is 60\" so Liam gets mad, almost supersonic and dismisses everything you can learn in the PMC as totally worthless. (I wasn't sure if you deliberately made the Brit pop reference but I went with it ha ha). As I've said before. I find Coggan an odd man, sometimes rude, argumentative for no reason and bare in mind the man is meant to be a scientist, trolls the Time Trialing forums regularly.

If you find Coggan posts, in the midst of all that mess and cat fighting, there's a couple of good links you might be interested in. In goes way more in depth than simply saying the better the CTL the fitter you are, but it is looking at a world class athlete over a hobby jogger. In the sense that, overtraining might be an issue. IMO the experience of being a hobbyist in both sports I've talked about and having trained mostly like this for a long, long time - Overtraining risk is almost zero and because in the grand scheme of things, you aren't training much at all. Simply put a higher CTL is likely better. But the good news for most of us being hobby joggers, is that means as long as we collect the data well, interpreting it is also easy. Once you get past hobby jogger territory, it gets more complicated and beyond my understanding. But I know Bradley Wiggins and his team were huge fans of the PMC data.

I’ll search my drive for it if you don’t locate it. I’m still in my 30’s but think I’m reaching that point where I’m forgetting more than I remember haha One of my very few pet peeves amongst (some) colleagues is when they use their PhD to assert superiority, as if someone who doesn’t have one can’t have knowledge (whether based on experience or learned) that either contradicts theirs or illuminates a concept they haven’t considered or don’t know about. I think with running (and endurance sport in general) it does seem that practitioners (coaches and athletes) are met equally in that regard since it’s hard to argue with results. I can see why using pace based TSS is preferable to HR TSS or TRIMP (the latter two are basically the same, correct?), specifically when running intervals. One, there is the initial lag in HR to an increase in pace. Two, if HR max is reached at approximately vVO2Max, you can obviously run workouts faster than that (especially for a 1500m runner), so then, how to quantify that and work it cohesively into the model. Additionally, the variance that comes with HR in regard to hydration, time of day, glycogen depletion, etc. I’ve wanted to work on a model that both quantifies the training load, like TSS, but also accounts for both diminishing return and the training benefit you’ll receive from it (meaning how it will impact the overall “aerobic vs anaerobic” push-pull component). Like you said in regard to updating your pace data for calculating TSS, as long as the athlete is maintaining that, I think there is enough biometric data being collected that those types of systems are possible now. The general principles can come from physiology and then be updated with learned experience and real world data. Standard machine learning, really. Btw, as a result of your posts, I did listen to a few interviews with Andrew Coggan, Stephen Seiler, Inigo San Milan, Olav Aleksander Bu. Good stuff!",

In terms of being tired after vo2 max sessions, I'm talking general fatigue. As in, it just leaves you a bit too tired to do the next session with the best quality. As well as how, for a hobby jogger, there seems to be unreasonable recovery time versus the benefits of the vo2 session, compared to sub threshold. Also, the fact that because it actually doesn't even create as much training load, on time limited hours, its hard to find the time with the extra recovery needed to up the training load. So, in my experience, the training load ceiling is lower - meaning it's harder to then push the envelope, hence greater chance of stagnation or not being able to go beyond that training cap.",

He went from ~100kg, inactive lifestyle to a 1:14 half marathoner. It’s a good reminder to never underestimate the potential in people. I’ve run some in Arizona, which is hot but arid. That environment compared to Florida, hot and humid, makes quite a difference to me too. Compared to hot and humid, hot and arid feels much better and performance doesn’t seem to be as negatively impacted. I definitely relate to the performance boost that accompanies a change in the seasons. Also, the general decline in overall fatigue, even though volume and intensity increase for me during the fall and winter. It's pretty incredible.",

However, if you can't recover well between the units, the best score does not help long term. Supercompensation principle is not fullfilled. So it is not so simple to put it only on a score value, whatever we use. -> I am sure this is possible up to a point. Below paper is interesting in a way as it can predict a marathon race time based on training data only. It shows that marathon race time depends on training distance per week (basically volume per week) and mean training pace. Mean training pace and volume has some correlation to a training stress score. It indicates also the importance of volume, already mentioned by me.",

I wouldn’t suggest to train based on a simulated process which takes no account of the individual response to training. I also pointed out that the time series is generated strictly by the TSS value so one could do a variety of runs to achieve that value. I actually thought the randomly generated values example demonstrated how CTL could be misused, if one is just chasing a number and giving no thought to structure. Reminded me of The Big Bang Theory episode when Sheldon resorts to coin flipping to make life decisions haha You seem really tuned in on the research occurring, so I imagine you’ve seen the impulse response models and even deep learning methods being used to better model training stress systems. Whether or not it results in an applicable break through, remains to be seen, I suppose. Basing training off simulation feels a bit too disconnected for me, if it's not tied to a firm foundational model of the underlying mechanism driving improvement, but I do like the idea of being better able to quantify what you're doing and determine if a positive adaption to training is occurring or if you’re overtraining and dismissing it as standard fatigue. To me, that's the frontier. Jack Daniels resolved any issue with race prediction and pace estimation in 1978!",

Someone training for HM - Marathon should without a doubt incorporate them. 5K-10K runners could get away with doing less. Mind you, some of the top 1500m runners are getting in long runs here and there, so they have their value even at much shorter distances. It also depends on the individual. I myself cherish the long run for multiple reasons, one being the psychological boost I get from going +20 km at once. It is also nice to run a weekly long run with my group, going on different routes and enjoying (or suffering) them together. One last perk I must not deny is the guilt-free admission to the massive breakfast that ensues. Regarding your question of incorporating a 30' sub threshold section into your + 2 hour long run, I think that this maybe overcooking things a bit. You might be better off doing a fartlek in the second part of the run.",

    "message": "One thing I would add though, is that for me ( and quite a few other cyclists) is that there's a pattern to FTP and CTL, no matter how you got there. I've reached my peak cycling CTL on a number of different training cycles, with totally different training to get there (sub threshold was the fastest way) but my 10 mile TT times were always mid to low 18s and my FTP around 315-20. If my CTL dropped off hugely in the winter, I could also roughly guess as a % of decrease what when I did my dreaded power test in January, the condition I was in. It's definitely not linear, but I'm seeing the same patterns now in running, using basically the same principles. To make it clear, I think this basic way of looking at it is mostly limited to a time crunched athlete. As in, to take it to a basic level , I would be surprised if someone who was on 5-7 hours a week wasn't at their fittest, if they just maximised their training load whilst balancing recovery. We are 40 pages in and I still stand by that for me to do that on my 7 hours a week, sub threshold 3x a week is almost certainly the best way , whilst looking at the theory of the stress it will accumulate but also looking at my fitness progression in real life. Obviously that's only applicable to me over a year, but KI is also a very good case study anyway can go look at , because he's literally shared a couple of years of data. Way back I shared the example of me just doing the turbo for a couple of hours a day or so 7 days a week, which also got me really fit (was probably just below sweetspot). I could have easily got even fitter doing that and throwing in one or two threshold or above work. But long term, I couldn't find the time. I only did it because I was off work with a broken collarbone so had limitless time. With limitless time, a more traditional approach with lots and lots of running and a lower % of harder work, will almost certainly be better. As in a pro might double and do 4x sub threshold sessions a week + some hill work, but % wise, almost certainly less than the 25% of weekly time proposed here. It's why I've always been iffy on Seiler the more I've thought about it. On 5 hours a week, I mean really, say 1 hour sub threshold is that really all one can handle? Not in my experience. As I said yesterday, once you get into the elite territory, it's much more of a balancing act and issues like overtraining actually become genuine concerns.",

But if I'm not doing a traditional \"long\" long run, but only 75-80 mins, the off day is where I'm going to do that in your concept 1 + the 3 easy runs and 3 quality and not have a day off. So to the 375 you can add another 75-80 TSS which is where I've been at for a the last few weeks (that is the current TSS numbers, it was obviously less before with less reps on workout days and less time on easy runs, hopefully that makes sense and shows how I've built up from maybe 380 TSS a week to around 440+ now). This is basically a very simplistic view of what I'm doing. I think if you hit this right, you really don't need a day off. I've never felt the need for one and I don't think Kristoffer often if ever has one. That's the point, to cram as much as you can cram in. If for some reason you can't run everyday, you may as well do concept 2. But I totally concede there is not much difference to your concept two, than what I'm doing, other than I'm probably racking up 20 or so TSS a week more. Over time, I'm my experience, that is worth something. If I was doing a marathon, no doubt I would probably do a much longer run, that's without question. Then on the Monday , probably a very easy run. But still do 7 days a week. If it makes for anyone's interest, I'll keep trying to creep up the length of my long run like Kristoffer. I went 80 mins and just over 10 miles this weekend, the longest I've done. Will require some life planning to keep increasing it, but might be doable. So far, my progress has been incredibly steady and I'm seeing PBs at a nice incremental increase in line with CTL. Making the long run longer gradually, will increase the training load slightly faster than it has been. Question will be if I can handle it or if PBs increase at the slightly quicker speed CTL increases. I'll see if I can plan something out that works around life.",

However, from a training perspective (particularly the example you gave where you rode about 2.5 hours per day at an easy-moderate effort), it’s rather curious as so much attention seems to be given to designing the optimal training plan. It provides a lot to contemplate in regard to what is optimal, I think. I like it! At the start of next week I’ll be 12 weeks out from a half, 18 weeks from a marathon. I ran my Garmin data through the algorithm and may try targeting the same CTL as last year but based on a 1 threshold, 1 medium long, and 1 long run approach.

    "message": "Actually, part of the reason I used the 24 week lead up to last years race was that I ran a 10km time trial every six weeks, so I programmed into it that update based on my time trial time. Out of curiosity, I estimated an “improvement curve” so that the threshold would scale more evenly across the six weeks blocks as opposed to just discrete jumps with each 6 week update. Wasn’t really worth the extra complication haha I don’t want to shoot my mouth off too soon, but my guess, based on the mathematics of the system, would be that using an exponentially weighted moving average, particularly without bias correction (which is just a technical term to say that the CTL would start at a higher value more representative of what you are doing at the start of training as opposed to taking a while to build up to where your average is), will require a while to build up to a CTL that is reflective of approximately your average daily TSS. So, if for example, you literally scored 60 TSS every day, it would still take about 100 days to get to a CTL value that will be within a few points of where it will level off. In this case the CTL would probably reach about 56. So you’ve put in about 14-16 weeks of training at that point. Using the physiological principle of ~6 weeks for “full adaption” you’re getting to that point where, for that cycle, you’re likely not going to improve much more. And assuming, as is true for most of us, that when we start a new cycle, we aren’t starting from “zero”, reaching a high CTL within a shorter time span is completely possible. I’d definitely be open to going through you’re data though and seeing if there are any further relationships. I’d say you’re intuition and observations have been insightful. I think the only thing I could add would maybe be a “mathematical” interpretation. Which I can’t imagine anyone cares to hear haha",

Last week I hit CTL 172/TSS 1388 and been averaging +160/+1100 for the past few weeks. While my workouts have been going well (mainly on the treadmill), I chocked up big time on my very rocky dirt-trail 5 km race yesterday. I decided to let go of lead two runners after 2 km (7:52.5), partly because I almost rolled my ankle on the course, and I am very injury prone when it comes to the ankle, so I shut it down thinking it was not worth sacrificing my massive training for a small club race, and partly from it being run in +90% humidity at 30 degrees C. I ended up jogging it in to the finish.

Looking back at my weekly CTL/TTS before the 37:45 10K I've run at the end of last March, it was in the 120-144 / 1000 range. I'm running much more now, so I expected a better result going into the race yesterday. I have 6 weeks till the half marathon now, but it will be in Europe where the weather is much, much more conducive to running fast. There is a similar 5K next week, also off-road and hot/humid.. I'm torn between letting it go and trusting the work I've put, or giving it another go. I realize that I won't run anything fast in relation to my PBs, but the competitive part of me wants some form of redemption. I must be the least talented individual out there if I'm running these sort of times with this much CTL/TTS.",

But I can't help but think you must have miscalculated something and just mentally had a bad day going into this race. Your weekly TSS seems insanely high. \"...experience to date indicates that, across a wide variety of athletes and disciplines (e.g., elite amateur track cyclists, masters-age marathon MTB racers, professional road racers), the “optimal” training load seems to lie at a CTL somewhere between 100 and 150 TSS/d. That is, individuals whose CTL is less than 100 TSS/d usually feel that they are undertraining, i.e., they recognize that they could tolerate a heavier training load, if only they had more time available to train and/or if other stresses in life (e.g., job, family) were minimized. (Note that this does not necessarily mean that their performance would improve as a result, which is why the word “optimal” in the sentence above is in quotes). On the other hand, few, if any, athletes seem to be able to sustain a long-term average of >150 TSS/d.\" - Coggan \"At least at this stage, the only think I might change about what I wrote above would be to lower the limits from 100-150 TSS/d to perhaps 90-140 TSS/d...\" - follow up from Coggan a few years later. Above are two quotes from Coggan with regards to CTL from the Time Trial forum. Also bear in mind that he is mainly talking about cycling and that runners you can probably drop that a little bit more (but not as much as people think, runners are very scared of their legs falling off as this thread has shown at times ha ha).",

    "message": "I imagine sirpoc will help you sort it out, but for reference to use as a quick back of the envelope calculation, IF of 0.70 would give 50 TSS per hour, IF of 1.0 would be 100 TSS per hour. So if you did 10 hours per week at your LT pace (FTP), that would give 1,000 TSS for the week. Where as if you did all your running at 0.70 IF (which is probably a good mark for the slow end of the easy pace range) that would be weekly TSS of 500. CTL will be around your average daily TSS. I saw those Training Peaks charts when I was reading through documentation these last few weeks. I have to say, their suggestions seem incredibly high, on the high end. To me, even if you are an elite, you’re probably running 12 hours per week +/- 2 hours at the peak of your training. For half marathoners and marathoners, Training Peaks suggests up to 18 hours per week! Haha As a general physiological observation, at around 2 hours per day (for runners), you’re basically peaking in regard to adaptation and benefit. I gave Training Peaks the benefit of the doubt and thought maybe they were including cross training in that (or some other low impact cardio), but to provide that as the guideline, seemed unrealistic at the high end.",

I've actually got 102 TSS once in my life for an hour (NP buster) where it's possible to actually score it AND have your zones correct, but it's rare and a flaw in the NP calculation IMO.

A quick glance at the intervals.icu numbers had me at a reasonable Fitness (CTL) of 47 for last week (compared to a CTL of 172 via TrainingPeaks). The intervals.icu number itself might be off too due to zones/threshold not correctly set yet, but it is good to have a rough idea. Now as to why the TrainingPeaks numbers are so off, I have yet to find out. For the sub threshold efforts on treadmill I can think of one reason on why it may overestimate the TTS: I leave the watch running during the rest to time my recovery, but in doing so, the NPE Runn Sensor is still picking up Distance/Pace from the moving belt and has me running (even faster since the belt is unloaded). I do end up subtracting this extra distance from the overall run summary, but I doubt it affects the calculations. However, as I discussed with Sirpoc, even my outdoor runs without such hassles have over values for TTS on TrainingPeaks, despite having accurate LTHR and Max HR values over there.",

I was then out for over 6 months. Right now I'm back at around 18:30 on 30 miles a week. That's about how much I can do at the moment.

It would help to know minutes you are doing a week, rather than miles. But the 1k repeats , less than 10x1 for you , would be around 6:20-25 pace. The 2 k repeats around 6:35 and the 3k repeats around 6:40. All with a minute rest. Say you are doing 4 hours a week, then spread out of an hour total , probably for you over 2 workouts. How I have interpreted this thread also though is that this really comes into its own around 5-8 hours a week. This seems to be the range I think this works best. I think sirpoc even said if he had more time, he might do things a little different . We have sirpoc really in depth posts and there's been plenty others who have going good following the broad approach, other than just him and the hobby jogger brother of Jakob. If you have 10+ hours a week doubles is the way to go in my opinion. Less than 5 than you are, I think shirtboy gave a very good suggestion, maybe even consider a lot of marathon paced work almost exclusively.

Summary of what he said. Run all workouts sub threshold, up to 3 workout a week. With no meter aim for paces. You must base pace from current fitness. If you live in hilly area, or like to do HR, do Joe friel hr test to find out your LTHR. You will then be aiming for Friel sub LTHR zone when running. 5k a sensible distance to do race if you haven't race in while so you have baseline for work with pace. Aerobic event and doesn't take too much out of user. 1k repeats around 15k pace. If you slower than 4 min per km, just run them as time instead, 15k pace for say 3-4 mins. 1600 repeats around 10 mile pace. 2-3k pace HM to 30k pace. Again, you can these on time if repeats are too long because right now you are slow. 8-12 min range from 2k up to 3k Easy runs all below average HR of 70 % max. Long run same. Just bit longer. This seems to be up to user . Sipoc seems about 30% longer than normal easy run. I think thread agree that If you do half or definitely marathon, might be worth user going longer. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. He just like KI has been going this long time. I added spoc on Strava, very boring - just like KI. How it should be if you do this correctly.",

Where as when the weather is good, I'd need to run around 4:00/km pace to be at the same heart rate. Another example would be today's long run during which my HR kissed 181 which is supposedly my LTHR, despite the pace being anything but fast.

Additionally, it will increase as your sweat rate increase, so if you lose ~1% bodyweight in an hour run, your heart rate could be 5-10 bpm higher from that. It’s hard to get exact measurements but when you have all those factors occurring together, it is certainly not uncommon to hit a high heart rate at the end of an otherwise easy 60-90 minute run in the heat. You could weigh yourself before and after a one hour run and get an approximation of how much you lose in fluid per hour.

    "message": "I was replying to this question of yours: “Everything I’ve seen so far on taking lactate measurements makes intuitive sense; i.e., if the session feels harder to hit pace (e.g., due to weather, a hillier course, etc.) then it results in higher levels of lactate being produced. So if the session feels harder due to tired legs, why would that result in lower lactate levels?” Specifically, how a session can feel harder but result in a lower blood lactate level. I wasn’t necessarily commenting on the claim that the pace was indeed the same, but it could be depending how the workout is structured (i.e. sufficient recovery). To answer your question. Yes, the metabolic pathway in this case did regress in the lower glycogen state leg to more fat and less carbohydrates being oxidized as a result. The lower glycogen leg also experienced a higher rate of glucose uptake. So, no you don’t want to go into a race carb depleted haha.",

Both sirpoc and Kristoffer Ingebrigtsten have shown you can easily target paces and basically just use the lactate meter to spot check for analysis at the end. Sirpoc I believe doesn't even use the meter now I do not think and KI is only using it to check at the end of his sessions to add to his log, not necessarily to do it after each rep anymore to target. The pace ranges sub threshold being broad enough that the paces they target aren't going to crush them and their lactate is almost always under their threshold. The only difference being the newer sessions KI is doing where he is purposely going over, but this a new development. In general when we talk about KI, most and almost all his training in a good year or so was all pace targeted, sub t. If I can suggest, I would say someone such as yourself should read this thread. You clearly have messed up training goodness knows how many times and actually I think this could be a good plan for you to follow.

    "message": "Thank you Hard2find, nice link as always. I am now more than just intrigued by this thread. The section of putting this into practice seems to be a lot of what yourself , shirtboy, sirpoc have been saying. Whilst training on this lower intensity, it doesn't quite give as good adaptations minute for minute BUT you can do way more of it because of the reduction of fatigue. It's really quite simple when you think about it. I think this is what links into on a more simple scale and non lactate testing, the use of the PMC as sirpoc has suggested. I was incredibly skeptical of this as first. However I have spent a week going back over things and injecting current fitness retrospectively as I had pbs to go on, so my data collection was pretty accurate. Things to note here. Firstly, it's clearly harder to score as much TSS when you do the zone 4-5 stuff. Point 2, threshold was easy to score TSS, I didn't feel tired during these blocks either yet you can see my CTL increasing and then maybe a few weeks after that, it's created a higher load and I've pb'd on multiple occasions. Note here, this was not my design, just chance that I sometimes do the odd threshold block to mix things up. But these based on my view of the pmc in training peaks, clearly is getting me the best results. I hope I get the term correct, CTL, TSS etc are very new to me and I've learned them from this thread. Sirpoc, I hope you don't mind me following you on Strava, seems a few others have. But I have to say looking back through your recent stuff and Kristoffers, it's hard to not be tempted into me committing to this from now until the new year. What I can see with both of you is that this is not a short term fix, but you both have clearly ramped it up on a tiny scale week by week, month by month but both clearly are staying healthy and getting stronger and stronger. I no longer have the luxury of 10+ hour weeks so this is an incredibly tempting way for me to try.",

There's probably things you can learn from it. But it's not the overreaching factor to be worried about. In general , I totally agree with the original approach on page one but the username spoc. I would look at the rental or borrowing of a meter, do some lactate tests and then find safe cautious paces you can follow on the flat or on treadmill rather than worrying about Hr too much. Also, thread is funny. Starting to weed out those who just want results now. Been mentioned in this thread many times. If you just want to short term improve PB, this is not the best training system. But long term it's probably the best for a HJ. But you will not likely see the huge jumps and gains you are expecting short term. But over time you will.

Taking the data from a race you'll just be too high. It would have me with a LTHR of 183 if that's the case. And if I ran all my sun threshold reps up to around 175-182, I'd be totally crushed. We've said before, there's many factors as why you can push a higher HR in racing than training. Considering virtually all of your running will be in training, it makes sense to just use Friel's test as the LTHR jump off point. Heart rate isn't the best for this type of training, but it's not horrible. If you then just use Friels zones, literally just aim for 80-90% of the time of your intervals (say 30 mins total) somewhere in his sun threshold zone. Will this be perfect? No. Will you get the majority of the training benefits? Probably you will. Just make sure you stay in this friel zone. Intervals icu is good, as if you are going to do this , set it up to create load by HR and it will show you what Friel's sub threshold range is. Side note, first time I have \"raced\" ( park run) back to back weeks in a long time. Today was the first time I have felt a little tired in a while. I think it shows how much when you are above threshold, the amount it fatigues you is pretty unreasonable. I did PB, so it was worth it. A side note to the side note, has anyone ever actually tested lactate at the end of a 5k? I mean I doubt I could get the test strip out of the wrapper, to be honest. I'm just curious, that's all.",

Some of many examples of this fast improvement was a couple of years ago when I coached an Irish master runner then age 43 on just low mileage and 5 sessions per week . He had family and 2 kids and worked often nights at a shift job. He did mostly one threshold interval per week . When I started to coach he had a best of 16:30 @ 5000m . After 2 months with this low mileage , lactate thresholds @ half marathon pace and 5 sessions per week he ran a 15:37 5000m. Some time after I had been the coach he told me he had kept on his own with the threshold intervals at half marathon pace and he was happy to tell he ran a 1:12. half marathon. I just say it to everyone who wants to listen to this advice it's most effective to directly point to the most effective threshold pace close to half marathon race pace. It's not a tough pace when you run it at reps 400-3000m. and after some time you quite easily can perform them in one session up to 16k/ 10 miles total and even more sometimes.

I’ve been using HR for this because I’m using a treadmill to control pace. Rather than use a Friel test, if you have been running for a while you can probably estimate a ballpark of where your threshold is. Then just target a bit lower than that…and see if your training is repeatable. If it seems too easy after a week or 2…increase the pace just a little. If you focus on gradual, long-term progression of both pace and volume…you’ll get to where you want to be.",

You have it, but many runners don't and everytime try to compare \"magic numbers\" with everything what is not. I just tell from my jogger experience, that there is no good correlation between those numbers and real lactate value, especially when we are joggers (underdeveloped, undertrained, beginning our journey, etc.), it is incorrect to say that sub-elite, elite runners have a good correlation and that is why me too must have. 👐 What's the point to run 5x6min or something similar by HRavg=158 (my threshold 165), when lactate that day says 2.5 mmol, but after 5 weeks says 1.7 mmol. In first case: overshoot, in the last case underperform? 😆 And calculator says that 158 should be ok. Somebody said here a \"golden words\": threshold is not a pace.

He tested a few times, sure. But then he raced. He adjusted his zones and the % of his new pb, guess what? His lactate was around the same again, for same % of the new pace. Obviously not perfect, but gets you within a good range. From that experience, plus a lot of others, the evidence suggests anywhere under LTHR is probably as good a guide a hobby jogger needs to start of this system. The Friel sub t zone will be as good as most hobby jogger needs. After 5 weeks of course your lactate could be less, for around the same pace. Obviously a number of factors. But you are too stubborn and clown shoes to realise your data is almost absolutely meaningless for context, you of course knew lactate readings but at virtually no point did you ever know your actual fitness to compare it to. Worthless. This thread has gone into amazing in depth detail I would argue, that is 10x better approach than the pure trash and nonsense you were doing. We have consistent paces, with a decent window to increase or decrease paces if needed, we have a great system that was new to most of us runners ( maybe not the ex cyclist or Tri guys with ctl) that allows us to monitor training load.

    "message": "I think lots of points on what coggan has said. IMO some of the main issues off the top of my head: Firstly - and this is very important. What is FTP? For a while it was an hour, then he doubled down on the fact that it was the power a rider could sustain in a 40km time trial (which is what he said 20 years ago and has now gone back to) This is where issues start IMO. As the time for that can be very different, for a large number of reasons. For example, I have an insanely low CDA, so the time it takes me to complete a 40km time trial in about 48 minutes, isn't that reflective in my opinion that my talent level means , that's how long it should take me. Secondly, I don't really like how normalised power works. In fact I don't like it at all. There's too many ways to trick the system. There's easily ways if you go outside and hit the hills, where you can do training sessions that hit TSS of over 100 per hour. Normalised power \"busters\". Not sure I really like TSB either. But, Coggan's reply is always it's been 20 years and is there a better system? The man is arrogant , but, he does have a point. But then he tries to be clever and say people are idiots for calling them zones, that they are \"training levels\". But other things as well, he will say the rest doesn't matter for example of vo2 max sessions, I've seen him claim before. Or he will not really explain why TSS probably under represents these sessions or dismissive of the evidence or the much greater fatigue they produce (therefore TSB). Also how he dismisses the aerolab in Golden Cheetah, despite myself and others having great success with it. In my opinion he doesn't understand it. But his science background can't accept hobby cyclists in the UK know more than him (which I would 100% stand by, even if I didn't understand the science behind it, I for sure knew how to analyse the data to reduce my cda and make myself faster). The fact that he's supposed to be a scientist, but is an online troll lol some of his distain to others. For example , mention Seiler to him \"what Seiler does for a living, I do as a hobby\" (referencing the fact, this actually, isn't the direct field he has most of his published papers in). Basically he's just a weird man. That's all off the top of my head . He is clearly a really clever guy, but I don't know what he brings to the table at this point. I think, personally, someone who has the real time, drive and understanding could make a better system than the current one. Maybe even something running specific. But, having said all of that - I do still think on a basic level and especially with this kind of training, the running version of sweetspot - the system does actually work quite well and you can still learn an awful lot from the PMC.",

    "message": "Great thread, thanks everyone for the contributions. I've been doing something a similar but a little easier than many of you here since this spring - each week a time-based threshold workout like (8x(3',1'), 6x(4',1'), 16x(1',1'), etc), a mini workout like 75' with 30-45' steady or 10x45\" hill reps, and then a easy/steady long run, on ~45mpw. The mini workout is a newer addition, I used to just run easy 75 mins. \"Problem\" is the paces are much slower than I'd think are reasonable. For example this spring most of the 3-5 min reps were around 6:50 pace but I raced 10mi at 6:30/mi (with a pretty strong negative split too) so that was a bit slower than hm pace. And now in the summer it's more like 7-7:15. The workouts feel like a decent effort, happy to be done them and I'm tired the next day but not like \"beat up\". No clue about lactate - as far as HR, it is maybe just getting to threshold HR in the last rep or two, but usually a bit lower. Most of the 10mi race was at ~175bpm and the intervals are typically in the 165-175 range. I run the workouts by effort though and check HR after. The minute reps are the only ones that line up pretty well with races, longer reps fall off even more. And my easy pace is very slow, 9-10 min/mi avg typically, maybe finishing an easy run in the mid 8s if weather is good. A 45 mile week takes me 7 hours. So I'm guessing its mostly just an endurance problem. I ran a 3:18 marathon in '21 and probably am not a whole lot better now, certainly not 3:00 like vdot suggests. Are these paces slow enough that it's a problem? Seems lots of people train slower than they race but this seems excessive. It seems like the workouts aren't progressing, even though there is no way I could have done that 1:05 10mi race a couple months prior. Is it time to move to 2 of these workouts a week? Tried it a little bit ago and ended up pretty tired after just 1.5 weeks. Not exactly sure about current fitness, doing a 5k in mid October to get a better idea. Have a trail half marathon in a couple weeks so didn't want to do a time trial yet. But ultimately training for a november marathon.",

The idea of sub threshold is not going for the most effective stimulus, but a stimulus that's sustainable for a once a day runner. Point 2, yes you don't need a lactate meter to do sub threshold sessions but using heart rate has deficiencies due to the lag. I would go off effort/pace. For example KI's 5 x 2000m on the treadmill for 1.9 lactate was at 3:35/km which is slower than his half marathon race pace of 3:28/km. If your intervals are 400s you could run faster pace for the same lactate/effort.",

I play around with this, going as short as 1 min and as long as 2 mins between reps. Break them up into sets if needed. the point with “respecting my aerobic weakness” is that it’s going to take me longer than sirpoc (semi pro cyclist) to recover aerobically from a given rep.

    "message": "I think if training for a mile or 5,000, for most recreational runners your mileage will end up in the 40-50 mile range here. The goal would be to hit 3 harder days each week. One of those days could be a race, it could be 200m hills, or if you are looking to run a longer day it could be some uptempo running in a 70-80' run. I like doing easy runs on non-workout/race days of 45-55'. And I'd look to do 5,600-7,000 in sub-T intervals on those 2 workout days. Higher end for lower intensity, longer intervals and vise versa. When I was training for the marathon/half, I ended up more like 60-70mpw. The specific long run helped, and I'd do uptempo threshold running in there. Like Jiggymeister, I built up the volume of my threshold intervals as I went, though probably ended up more like 5-5.5 miles of work.",

Pay attention to how the workout makes you feel in the next couple of days after. Do you feel tired, sore or do your legs just not have any pop? Do you feel great and ready to go again? Are you injured? I think starting with 3-4 miles worth of work and hanging out there for a few weeks would be good. It also depends on your age, how long you've been running and where you want to go. Jakob has allegedly been doing double-thresholds since he was a child. Theoretically, you can do a lot no matter what age you are, but if you can't stay healthy or you can't absorb the training then there isn't any point.",

I haven't fully gotten my brain around some of the maths earlier in the thread though. If you move from a 17min 5k -> 16 min 5k and update your threshold zones appropriately, am I right in saying 5x2k at a similar relative threshold level would product the same TSS? This makes me feel like you'd end up with the same long term CTL doing the same workouts at the same relative threshold (even though you will be doing all the workouts faster as a 16min 5k runner), but from your statement I would have thought CTL would be higher when you're running 16 vs 17 mins.",

    "message": "Good news, bad news. Bad news first. If you get faster and are running the same workout at the same relative intensity, (i.e. 5*2000m at say 0.95 Intensity Factor) your TSS will actually be lower, since TSS is a function of time and intensity factor. Therefore, your CTL will eventually decrease as well, all else the same. This will be marginal though and it will take a while to appear, as CTL is a 42 day weighted average. You'd notice a change in ATL more prominently, since that's just a 7 day weighted average. So, if you're chasing CTL (as opposed to performance), you have to either increase the time spent running at the same intensity factor or run the same duration at a higher intensity factor, in order to see an increase long term. The obvious reason that you would want a higher CTL is that it means you're doing more work, relative to your previous training. Like mileage though, there is a component of diminishing return. Meaning, you can keep bumping up your CTL and not necessarily see an improvement in performance, even though you are imposing more stress/load. Concluding with the good news... you improved your 5K, hypothetically, from 17 minutes to 16 minutes!",

Obviously if you stayed at 9x1k forever, and ran it at 15k pace , you would always get the same CTL. In fact, it might even decrease as the time it takes would get faster. But this is where I talk about, gradually increasing over time. So I make a big fitness jump, I need to run faster for the easy run, for the same CTL, but I've gone from easy run being 45 mins, to 50 mins, then 55 mins and now at roughly 60 mins. This will slowly increase your load. Same with the reps. I started off doing 8x1k I'm at 10x1k. My 3x3k has become 3x3200 and so on. I hope that makes sense. For example , I'm creating TSS now of 460 ish a week, maybe 6 months ago it was 400. Over say a 6 week period, my CTL might increase maybe by 3-4 points. That doesn't sound like much, but over time it really adds up. This I'm my opinion, is why this is so sustainable. I would say on this system and singles, 8+ hours is about the limit.",

I've possibly had a fitness breakthrough, hard to tell. I might do a park run next week to find out. I have the Great south run 10 miler coming up in a few weeks. Basically yesterday , I ran as an experiment to see if you could run to HR on the sub threshold intervals (HR caps are great on the easy runs though, IMO) I've never tried this before tbh, but it's been spoken about here so I thought I would try it. My goal was to never go a over LTHR, I didn't have anything else at all on the screen. Literally just HR. Was quite easy, until you get to the last few reps. Then I totally blew the workout on the last 1k but just thought may as well finish it off at this point, especially as I hadn't raced in a few weeks. This, I think is the problem with running to HR. If I had run to pace, I would have never gone over. Then when I saw the pace, I was actually shocked how quick it was , 3:29 /km average. Maybe other people might have more luck, but I feel I have the paces (for me) worked out nicely to lactate levels so I'm definitely just going to stick to that.",

    "message": "On that note of HR, I find that it is helpful to follow but you can’t really base the pace off it. The problem is that on short (1k or 3 minute) reps you haven’t reached a stable HR by the end. And on the longer 10 minute reps it can take 5+ minutes to level out. So HR is more helpful to track and look at afterwards. I’ve been doing all workouts on the treadmill to control pace, and I think HR is a useful metric for the load of each session. But it lags too much to be the target for intensity within a rep. It can be useful for adjusting (increasing) speed for the next rep.",

What seems to work best, if you want to use HR for these workouts, is to progress through the different zones. Start quite a bit slower than threshold, closer to LT1. This could be 10-20s per mile slower than threshold. Maybe more. Then work the pace down. It depends a bit on the length of the rep, but always err on the side of slower. The first rep of the workout your HR might only be at 75% of max. Maybe just under. That’s fine. The next rep, run a little faster. HR will still be low. After a few reps, settle into the 80-85% of max HR range. The bulk of the workout should be here. The last rep you can push the HR up a bit. It might even happen naturally depending on the circumstances of the workout. Play around with it. It’ll take some time to get it right.",

    "message": "Checking in with a status update… tl;dr It’s working for me. YMMV Results: 2 months in and VO2max is up three ticks to the highest I’ve recorded since getting this watch in April 2020. I don't race much, so this is the best way I have to gauge progress YMMV: I take beta blockers so VO2max workouts are difficult. I’m naturally endurance inclined (which is magnified by the meds), so high mileage/low intensity rarely moves the needle. The Norwegian porridge seems just right given those constraints. Workouts: Using Hobbyjogger Ingebrigtsen workouts as inspiration. No doubles and only running four days a week so far. Going to keep doing this until I either stall out or need to up mileage for a long race or something. First month did about 30 min of work per session. Second month shot for 31. Next month I’ll do 32. And so on. Hobbyjogger Ingebrigtsen seems to be topping off at around 45 min of work per session. Effort: Lactate testing is logistically too complicated where I train (and not to mention pricey) so doing educated guesses on pacing using heart rate, Whoop strain, and perceived effort. This thread was very helpful in discerning where I need to be despite not doing lactate testing. Shoes: Wear regular shoes for warmups, cooldowns and easy runs; Carbon trainers for work intervals to improve recovery on my old lady legs Lifting: Lifting sessions of 0-60min daily based on fatigue and recommendations from my lifting app. Lifting to improve some imbalances and for vanity. Advice: This type of training requires a constrained ego. You will finish the workouts feeling less than satisfied. If you grew up like me in the era of “if you didn’t see god, you weren’t running hard enough in the workout”, it’s a big mind shift. When in doubt, run slower than you want to.

    "message": "Totally agree. Why not just stick to one protocol and use that? CV is absolutely useless in the spirit of this excellent thread. I mean, by the time you have ran 4-5 races or time trials to determine CV, you've probably got fitter, right? So you will just have to start all over again. Just run a 5k or 10k and I've been using the rough guide someone posted up in this thread summary some pages back and it's just about right for me with lactate testing to check. 15k pace for 1k reps gets me nice to where I want. Basically just run a 5 or 10k race and just calculate it from that. Same with my 3k reps. Just run HM pace or a touch slower. I mean really why to try over complicate yet another arbitratory debatable physiological point? I will search for the Strava group, sounds interesting. Thank you everyone.",

    "message": "In the thread attached above (i guess on page 5) you find several ways to calculate CV. CV is not a fixed value, i do not define it with 30minutes, and it moves up or down based on fitness level and other things. You can use also a single race, 5k is best, to calculate it. If you train below CV you have a buffer (distance to CV) and combined with a lacate meter and/or HR or perceived effort you have a good indicator. CV is related to MLSS, it is a little bit higher (faster) as MLSS, with the original scientific definition. So basically CV is a threshold which can replace MLSS without using any lactate meter and measurement. How cool is that?",

If statistics suggest, after reviewing the results of the accrued data from the research literature, that CV is approximately 30 minute race pace, then you can simply run a 5km race and, based on well established methods, approximate your 30 minute race pace. I like data, math and science as much as anyone else in the field, but I find the idea so impractical. It's almost laughable that it's even proposed. Which to be fair, I know it likely has it's roots in cycling so they can recover from an all out effort slightly better than a runner I imagine due to negligible impact forces.

I've got those saved somewhere haha. My point though is that if you use the hyperbolic function and interpret it strictly mathematically, you can theoretically maintain CV well beyond 30 minutes, even beyond 60 minutes. In practice, that's not even close. It does generally fall around 30 minutes +/-. That's another issue, you can not only get an estimate of CV but also get an estimate of races that exceed 30 minutes (which since most of us are distance runners would be helpful) by using a function with two exponentialy decaying terms where the asymptote is likely closer to your aerobic threshold.",

    "message": "Sorry, to clarify, I’m not suggesting my result indicated a pace I could maintain for 60 minutes or longer (it indicated 29 minutes to be exact). I’m saying that if you treat the model purely mathematically, it does suggest you can run at the CV pace obtained for 60 minutes or longer, even though in practice it is observed and recognized that you can’t. My question, acknowledging that, is why not just define it as 30 minute race pace? And I don’t mean you specifically but the idea in general. Save the 4-5 time trials and hyperbolic function for sprint and middle distance athletes and just use a single race effort to approximate CV. Also, from that race effort, you can obtain classic race distance predictions via standard methods. The hyperbolic function can’t provide that (using the 2-20 minute race effort protocol) because it asymptotes at approximately 30 minute race pace, in practice. On that last topic, I read a paper that Andy Jones published where he used 1500m - 15km times of 12 elite athletes to approximate CV and compare it to marathon race pace. That’s obviously slightly different than the 2-20 minute race time protocol but the results he obtained were still interesting. Of course, that interested me (as you say, I’m data man), so I pulled the data for the top 200 times run in the 1500m, 3000m, 5000m, 10000m, half, and marathon. Using just the 1500m - 10000m I fit the model to those 200 performances in each category, so it is an approximate average. The CV for that dataset is 360.26 meters per minute, which if you multiple by the average time for the 10km of the group works out to 9,748.64 meters, so slightly slower than 10km pace for a group that averaged 27:04 for 10km (369.55 m/min). To illustrate my point about the mathematical implications of the model though, for that group, the hyperbolic function is Time = 274.99 / (Speed - 360.26) Say you run 3 meters per minute slower than CV, so 363.26 meters per minute. The result would suggest you could run for 91.66 minutes at that pace. Using the half marathon from that dataset shows an average time of 59:16, which is 356.01 meters per minute. So obviously slower than the speed predicted, meaning it wouldn’t be possible to maintain that speed for 60 minutes, in practice, let alone 91.66 minutes. This is my point about the undesirable asymptotic behavior of the model. I hope that clarifies it. I was tempted to use more graphs and analysis but refrained… for now haha. Also, I hope this shows that I’m not being disingenuous in saying I’m interested in this concept. There are just some aspects of it that seem peculiar when going from theory to practice.",

Take the equation I provided which uses the data from IAAF for race times at 1500m, 3000m, 5000m, and 10000m. This produces the following hyperbolic function with 274.99 being the estimated D’ parameter and 360.26 being the estimate CV parameter: Time = 274.99 / (Speed - 360.26) For reference, 369.55 m/min for 27.06 min, and 356.01 m/min for 59.27 min are the speed and time for the 10km and half marathon, respectively. As your speed approaches the critical velocity speed, using the above formula, this happens: Speed = 370.26 m/min. Time = 27.50 min Speed = 369.26 m/min. Time = 30.55 min Speed = 368.26 m/min. Time = 34.37 min Speed = 367.26 m/min. Time = 39.28 min Speed = 366.26 m/min. Time = 45.83 min Speed = 365.26 m/min. Time = 55.00 min Speed = 364.26 m/min. Time = 68.75 min Speed = 363.26 m/min. Time = 91.66 min This is what I’m talking about when I say undesirable asymptotic behavior. As the speed approaches the critical velocity, the estimated time exceeds what is observed as sustainable in practice, but you are still technically running faster than your critical velocity and not violating the assumptions of the model, correct?",

If you enter 360.26 as speed in your formula you get time=274.99/0 which is not defined mathematically. The Norwegian model does not need D' or W', we can use the Norwegian model with just CV only, because we operate close below CV. I see CV as a marker which can replace MLSS, without doing any lactate measurement to identify MLSS, and a marker which you should not cross over it (running faster than that) for the purpose of this thread. The calculation of CV has its accuracy, so doing the reps below CV with a small distance to CV is recommended.",

I started on June 27th after 3 years of injury issues. 2022 was the worst running year of my life and I made a commitment to run at least a mile a day this year regardless of health issues. All that to say that I jumped in with very little base. I live in a very hilly area and refuse to drive the 15 miles to the nearest track, so I run hilly intervals. I have no data on threshold levels, Max HR etc, so I ran a couple of hard solo 5kms (17:30/17:20) two weeks apart and based my interval paces/HR zones off of them (I know, very unscientific, but I'm 40 and had nothing to lose if this didn't work). I run more by feel and check data post workout to make sure perception is close to reality. I have averaged about 42km/ week these past two months + a 30-50km cycle biweekly. The last two weeks of July I didn't run intervals due to time constraints. I just ran a rainy track 10km in 34:45! This training works for me. The difficult part for me is holding back at the beginning of intervals and slowing down between reps. If you're stuck in your training, not recovering between workouts, unable to stay healthy doing fast intervals, ... I would recommend trying this type of training. I'm going to go for low 34 with super shoes in a few weeks. *sub 32 10km pb is 16 years old",

    "message": "I would like to chime in on this great thread both as encouragement to you guys to continue and to add another data point. I used this \"Time crunched, low mileage, Norwegian-Inspired\" method in 2021-22 to run a 4:40.4 mile (track) and 17min 5k (road) at age 40 after taking 20 years off from competitive racing and dedicated running. Those were the only two races I ran--the 5k in November 2021 and the track mile April 2022. After becoming fascinated reading about the Ingebrigsten and Bakken method, and how radically it differed from my HS and college \"All-out, all the time\" training, I decided to try it out myself and target a mile race at age 40 as a personal experiment/ curiosity project. Background fitness: last college track season 2003. Racing weight 160 lbs. College coach system: Vo2 max intervals on Tuesday (Huffing and puffing after each rep, long rests, basically as fast as you can complete each rep) example: 5x mile. Shorter, faster reps on Thursday with long rests. Again, each rep as fast as possible. Example 10x 300m. \"Tempo\" run on Saturday. 4 miles. AKA a 4 mile race for all but the top guys. \"Easy\" runs Mon, Wed, Fri. 8-9 miles, getting to 6:00 pace and staying there. Long run Sunday, 15 miles, 6:00 pace. Minimal exercise 2004 to 2015--work, wife, kids, etc. = 200 lbs dad bod. Recreational cycling 2015-2020 (three to five times per week with fellow middle aged dads). Not competitive cycling like Sirpoc, but spirited MAMIL riding. No power meter, intervals, etc. Annual cycling mileage during these years: 2400, 4800, 2900, 3600, 1800, 4100. This got me down to 185-190 lbs and much better cardio fitness than the previous decade. During these years I would run 0-2 times per month, usually three miles progressing from 8:00 at the start to 6:00 by the end. Decided to start the running project in earnest November 2020. Treadmill 3-4 nights per week. 4 miles at 8:00 pace. December 2020 increased to 5 times per week. Kept the same 20 mpw at 8:00 pace on the treadmill through March 2021. Bought a GPS watch with wrist HR March 2021 with the idea the point of this device is to LIMIT my pace and HR. Total mindset switch from my youth. By watching food intake, got under 180 lbs. First outdoor run with watch late March 25, 2021: 4 miles, avg 7:47, HR under 150 bpm always. April was spent gradually increasing average run to 6 miles. The word \"threshold\" shows up in log for the first time April 27, 2021--4 x 2:00 with 1 minute rest at what I felt was \"comfortably hard\", around 6:00 pace. At this time I decided I had better define my paces better, so I ran an all out 1 mile time trial on May 3 in flats on a hardpacked dirt road--5:15. I then used the online Tinman calculator and plugged in 5:10 mile as the reference, figuring a race on a track in spikes was worth 5 seconds. Spent May to October 2021 trying to build gradually and avoid injury, eventually finding the regimen that fit my work/kids schedule: Mon: Threshold Tuesday: easy Wednesday: OFF Thursday: Threshold Friday: easy Saturday: easy Sunday: \"long\" aka usually 10 miles; minimum 8, max 12miles. My threshold sessions were most often intervals of 3:00 (min 4 reps, max 8), 4 x5:00, or 2-3x 10:00. The rest was ALWAYS 59 seconds--to make sure I kept the intensity low enough that instead of panting and wishing for more recovery as in my youth, I was raring to go by 60 seconds. My easy runs were NEVER allowed to go faster than 7:00, usually above 8:00. I often did 10 x 6-8s hill sprints/bounds after these easy runs. Long run usually averaged 7:00 pace. The most important points about this training was how EASY it was, and the complete lack of DREAD. Unlike my youth, no need to get psyched up for the workouts, and no no need to dread the gut-busting next interval because there is no gut busting with this system. Time for bed now, but if you guys are interested, I will post my exact log with workouts and weekly mileage.",

I also tried doing some of my easy runs in the nike zoom x invincible, but they were so huge and clunky I didn't like them and did most of my easy volume in a \"normal\" trainer like a saucony kinvara. I think these foams allowing such superior recovery can not be overlooked as a factor in this model of cramming as much threshold in the week as possible without breaking down, and certainly contributes to why people from HS to pros are so fast now.",

    "message": "Nice to see the thread going, I haven't logged in for a while. Very happy with a new PB of 16:55. Feel like on a fast course could be easily into the 16:40s. One thing I will say, is the debate is fantastic , but keep it simple. If you don't or won't or can't use a lactate meter, I still stand by the paces roughly I started with posting. I've helped a good few people out, the reps from 1k(3-4 mins) up to 3k+ (or 10 mins) seem to be working the best. As long as you know your current fitness, a good starting point is still 1k reps at no faster than 15k pace, 1600m reps at a fraction slower than 10 mile pace, 2k reps at HM pace up to 25k pace - and 3k reps around 25-30k pace. This as a starting point. You might find it shifts a little per individual, but having helped a few people now, I don't think those as a starting point, has sent anyone into the crazy spheres of being trashed. Obviously the number of reps is important, but stick still to around a max of 25% sub Threshold over the 3 days ( in terms of time in zone) of your total weekly volume. So if you are doing maybe 5 hours a week, but then you start trying to run 10x1k , you'll obviously wreck yourself. 5 hours a week, would be 75 mins total spread across 3 workouts, 5.5 hours would be 82-83 mins, 6 hours 90 mins- and so on. Less than 5 hours, probably isn't going to work. There's probably a cap on doing this in singles, that's probably 8+ zone. Easy runs still cap at an absolute max of 70% MHR to make it even more simpl, rather than starting to talk about MAS. If you want to begin and just try this out for 4-6 weeks, I honestly don't think you need to over complicate it more than this as a pure starting point. Considering we are 50 pages in, that's still relatively simple. Once you get past that stage, then maybe start to dig around in the weeds and tweak things a bit or looking into the training metrics and stuff talked about. But give it a good month to 6 weeks without worrying about anything too much than just following the basics. Edit: one other thing, \"Fusio\" has made the group on Strava, I don't even know how to stare the link to stuff like that, but there's a good number of people on there and it's already proved useful with some guys and gals sharing snippets of things.",

    "message": "It’s not even that the function is undefined at the critical speed. To me, it’s that the prediction for the duration, without violating any of the model assumptions, suggests you can maintain CS far longer than is actually possible. Even if you ignore that inaccuracy and accept that it is not the goal of the model to provide both a speed and a duration (either time or distance) for the CS, are you not left with the conflict created by stating that the CS determines the boundary between the severe intensity domain and the high intensity domain? Yet, because that speed which demarcates the two domains is CS and the model suggests it should be maintained for X minutes, X should also mark where the severe and high intensity domains reside. But that would be a point that, again, in practice is observed to be unrealistic. Is that not a perplexing discrepancy? I don’t want to go on about it here as it is not the theme of the thread. Also, maybe this has already been addressed but I suspect not, since I assume you would have said so? I’m going to start a thread on this topic though, as it’s curious to me (not so much in application but conceptually) with the hope that maybe some exercise physiologists or better informed individuals than myself will chime in. In an attempt to summarize this concept though, as well as provide some more “grade school graphs” to the participants of this thread, I put together two documents. One is an overview of the critical speed model with some details not identified in the papers and videos I’ve seen. The second document uses VDOT to not only provide CS paces for all VDOT values but also identify the duration CS can be maintained based on a runners VDOT value and at what percent of 5km pace it occurs. P.S. The second paper may also be of interest to undergraduates in applied maths and sciences, as a project. There’s some interesting ideas and applications, I think. Most especially if additional data were added to the mix. If, despite the lottery winning level of probability, someone does find this interesting, I can post the code (python) used to generate the results.",

    "message": "So, the assumption I made was that while the hyperbolic model can’t predict the duration at critical speed, the critical speed value itself, which is estimated using the 5 test results in the 3-20 minute time frame, is the “true” critical speed. Therefore, that’s all that is needed from the hyperbolic model. From there, using VDOT, you can calculate the percent of VDOT that the CS occurs at for each VDOT value, then using an iterative algorithm (Newton-Raphson Method in this case) calculate for what duration of time that speed can be maintained. I’ll go through again though and read the code to make sure it executed as I conceived it. The appendix goes through what I did specifically to generate the calculations. I realize the math may not be accessible to everyone (which first assumes that the document itself is of interest to anyone haha), but part of the reason I included it at the end was, for those who are interested and can follow along, feel free to call me out if you think I made an error or an improper assumption. I’m more than willing to answer criticisms, as long as it's constructive. Btw, lexel, I produced A LOT more data than I included in my “document dump” haha. If you want, I can send it to you? I pulled data from IAAF too and calculated a bunch of athletes critical speed curves but also fit performance curves to their race times from 1500m - marathon. Plus, I have additional data from the VDOT calculations. Let me know. One other idea I had was to create a performance curve based on 1500m, 5000m, and 10,000m times (since those distances are frequently raced), then use the values estimated from that curve, at the same time intervals as I used in the VDOT document, to construct the hyperbolic function. From there, I could test how similar the VDOT values are to what the athletes have actually run. Maybe I’ll give that a go this weekend haha",

    "message": "To your point about the difference in the D’. It’s not that it’s wrong, but it will be different, as you identified, using the IAAF table. The IAAF are more “generous” in the race times that they consider equivalent. For example, System: 5km, 10km, Half, Marathon IAAF: 17:30, 37:32, 1:23:49, 3:05:35 VDOT: 17:30, 36:17, 1:20:14, 2:47:41 I do tend to think Daniels can be a little fast with the predictions the longer the race distance goes, but mainly because most people do not run enough mileage to be “equally” trained for the longer distance as they are/were for the shorter distance, not necessarily because it's physiologically impossible. Also, the longer out you project, the more variability, in general. I tend to think the reality lies somewhere between those two equivalencies, for most people. It’s a good point you make though, regarding the basis used for prediction. P.S. You have very different D' values for your VDOT than I do, which I assume is due to a difference in the sample size and/or range of the test protocol used to estimate the CS and D' parameters. Maybe we can dig into that over email. I have a table that shows the percent difference in the estimated CS based on the number of tests 3-5 and the range of times used. It can be over a 5% difference in estimated CS based on the input.",

It has to do with what I mentioned previously about the IAAF having slower equivalent times than Daniels as the distance gets longer, plus the way you estimate the parameter D'. D' = d - cs*t , where d is the average distance and t is the average time. Since you're using the same distances with different times, d will be constant throughout your calculations. cs and t are the variables changing. Since the times for IAAf are slower relative to the same starting distance (say 1000m using your data) than Daniels, the CS calculation will be slightly slower for the IAAF data. That also means the average time, t, will be slightly higher than compared with Daniels. It's a very marginal change but that results in an increasing cs*t term, compared to Daniels which decreases as the performances get faster. And thus, since the average distance for IAAF and Daniels is constant, subtracting an increasingly larger number from a constant results in an increasingly smaller number for D'. Hope that helps.",

Gonna chime in with my experience recently, I just capped off a half marathon cycle where I peaked at 70 mpw and did the vast majority of my workouts at threshold with a handful of double T days once every 2-3 weeks. Everything seemed to be going well, I was feeling great in workouts, and I ran a 35 second 5k PR in August after only doing one race pace session the week before. Then I completely bombed my goal half this past weekend, missing my goal time by four minutes. I think I mostly just had a bad day and I was fit enough to run at least two minutes faster. Still, it seems like the Norwegian approach is best suited for 1500-10k (you know, the distances that the Ingebrigtsens run), and there's no substitute for high mileage for the longer stuff. Since threshold is pretty similar to HM race pace, I thought I could benefit doubly from maximizing the volume I ran in that zone. I now think this was a flawed strategy, and I was essentially making the same mistake as a 5k specialist running all his workouts at VO2 pace. Still, I'm happy with the overall fitness gains I made in the past few months, and this system clearly works if you apply it correctly.",

It's specifically copying the training of the 'hobby jogger' Kristoffer Ingebrigtsen (coached by Henrik) who uses this on a continuing rolling basis doing only singles and not huge volume (although his volume has steadily increased). Nor is it specifically for shorter races, he continues to use this approach for HMs. His progress in a relatively short time has been impressive, although I'm sure he has some genetic advantages!",

    "message": "I think the polarised nature has been brought up before, but it's hard to remember in 1000 posts 😅😂 Polarised has always been how I have thought of it, but then Seiler enthusiasts (and the man himself) always get upset as this is polarised, but not in the literal sense he prescribed or championed, in the sense it's not totally at the end of both scales- as in, there is no really hard in the system I've been using (aside from racing now and again). However, I believe this works better for the reasons that I have gone into. Firstly, Seilers version of polarised training is actually more like 85/15 when you see the actual studies, even more like 90/10 for the absolute elites, whereas what I am doing is about 75/25. In simple terms, in isolation the Seiler style \"hard is hard\" sessions that account for the 10-15%, are definitely harder. But, you can't do as many of them in a week. So if you stick to his rules for the 75% (under VT1), but replace the 25% with manageable runs that are reasonably hard, but easy to recover from, you can generate more TSS weekly. It just happens sub threshold, ticks all those boxes, once you work up to it, 3 sessions a week are pretty easy, I've done this now for almost 16 months, every single week in that time. In the spirit of the thread and pure simple terms, the 25% (+-2) in this system is simple worth more (training load) than the 15% in Seilers classic polarised approach. FWIW, Seiler himself has backed down a bit on this lately, as he lives in Norway and clearly Jakob is changing things. Previously, he was basing most of what he was applying from Norwegian cross country skiing, or that was at least his starting point. As I've said before, this is nothing new, Time Trialists in the UK have been training like this for a while, it just seems that for me at least, it translates well into running.",

    "message": "Seiler came into discussion, because at the beginning he sold it in a way that he invented it. He did not invented it he studied the training distribution of successful athletes. And that does not mean this is the optimal training distribution. This is important to understand. What works for one, does not need to work for others. Seiler made his analysis too simplistic in my opinion. He has only 3 zones. 3 Zones are not enough. Seiler counts everything below 2mmol as Zone 1, however it is a difference if you train at lactate baseline (around 1mmol for most) or close below 2mmol. That is not the same effort, recovery time is different. He missed an important information here. And on the high end he does not use CV as a marker, he uses typically 4mmol as a marker between his zone 2 and 3, This is also not optimal, as the Norwegian model lands close below CV as outlined by me in very detail. So is see your approach not all in the Seiler way, because Seiler simplified it too much. In the K.Ingeb. system, which you copied and presented here, easy means very easy, staying at the lactate baseline, and quality is close below CV, and there is no other training in-between. That is the polarization i am thinking off.",

    "message": "Absolutely agree, Seiler flip-flaps between what he means, much like Coggan, it's very hard to actual pin down what their current position is. I bring in Coggan, because despite the fact he has become almost a parody of himself and an internet troll on the time trialing forums at times, we can apply a lot of his metrics here. But if you speak to Seiler, he will tell you it cannot be polarised this way, from a pure definition point, in the sense that the word itself means opposite ends of the spectrum, whereas a lot of this training sits more in the middle of a scale. I actually think you could just call this sweetspot training, as it's clear it's much like the cycling power zone that is specifically designed to create as much CTL, without crushing you. That's basically what is happening here, just without the use of a power meter - and obviously the impact of running means we can handle less (for instance I could easily rack up 100 CTL on the bike, but 65 now from running probably feels as hard, if not more than generating 100 cycling). I've spoken to Hard2find quite a bit about this and there is definitely an opportunity for someone, somewhere to make something better to apply to running. Using TSS I still think works for running, but probably only if you apply it to this model of training. It still totally underrepresents the really hard sessions. But then again, NP on the bike can be manipulated and broken, so maybe nothing is perfect, but I digress. I wouldn't say it's fair to say I copied KI, I noticed he was doing something similar in terms of running that myself and others had been doing for over a decade in cycling. But he certainly inspired me to just go back to basics and have the confidence you can of course train like this, with relative success, not just on the bike but running. FWIW, I've not seen enough people doing this long term in running to comment, but absolutely nobody I encountered on the UK Time Trial scene didn't increase their FTP if they stuck to this as their training method for a decent period of time. The Strava group is interesting, which is why I haven't posted here much, as you can see who is training this way and their successes. I also agree with you that 3 zones Seiler presented isn't enough, again they have changed over time. I think he's more in line with a 5 zone model now. Obviously as you say, saying anything below 2.0 mmol is ridiculous to say that's \"easy\" and zone 1. If I ran the top end of that , each day, I would be totally and absolutely crushed and there is no way I would be able to run the 2.5-3.5 mmol sessions 3x a week I target. In fact, I suspect I would get injured or something if I ran 4 days at the top end of Seilers zone 1 and then tried the 3x sub threshold days.",

On the other hand it is really hard to respect a well known , i.e. Seiler, if he does not know that a close below 2mmol unit is not the same effort, as a lactate baseline effort and counts is as one zone.

I know from a decade of experience as a hobbyjogger that 'run more miles overall and as much as possible at threshold' is something I respond well to. But the intensity has to be right. For example, 'easy interval method' which I stumbled upon on this board actually made me a tiny bit slower and a great bit grumpier, most likely reason – incorrect 'threshold'. I used pace tables, HR, Stryd footpod, why not try lactate? Ok, one reason it is expensive and messy, but I can afford that for my hobby. Being the latest fad is also a big plus for me: lots of people to discuss it with, and open field for experiments on myself (as opposed to blindly following a book).",

What I do is set up a table in the middle of the track (since it's empty on the weekends) and have my alcohol, towels, lactate meter, etc. ready so that way when I get close to my sample time, I can veer into the center of the track to end the rep at the table. First, I'll wipe my hand, apply alcohol, fan dry and then insert the lactate sample strip into the meter. While the meter is turning on, I'll lancet my finger and get a good drop of blood...then wipe the first drop away with a clean towel. I'll collect the sample on the second drop of blood. Make sure your finger is DRY. If the blood drop runs like a broken egg yolk, clean off your finger better. All in all, this should take about 30 seconds and the results comes 13 seconds later (or however long your meter takes). Rinse and repeat. This weekend I'm doing two track workouts: Saturday: 3 minute and 12 minute time trials. Gives me CP/CV and W'/D', and VO2 max estimate from Cooper test equation. I get two suprathreshold lactate values from the time trails. Sunday: Step test with 4 subthreshold paces for 10 minutes each. Gives me four subthreshold lactate values...ideally I'll see LT1 and LT2. Easy peasy.",

Please ignore anything that is ad nauseam at this point. There is evidence supporting CP/CV as the new gold standard for defining the threshold, over the (quasi) maximal lactate steady state, which tends to be ~4% lower with the common 30-minute protocol. This difference largely seems to be due to the short trial durations used to calculate CP/CV, which have less built-in fatigue than MLSS. However, this could still be useful to define a subthreshold effort, and the single visit protocol for MLSS may directly equate to CP/CV so then they could be used interchangeably, in addition to it already being 'close enough' for the purposes of training. Regarding LT1, my view is that Seiler et al are wrong to consider this a threshold in any real sense of the word because it's inherently above baseline yet not a functional threshold, like LT2, which we know is basically where the wheels fall off the bus in distance running. To me, it seems to be through protocol an arbitrarily selected point on an exponential curve that increases with intensity. Furthermore, it seems inappropriate to call <LT1 low intensity and >LT1 high intensity, like if you get 0.5 mmol/L over, you suddenly jump to the other end of the intensity domains. The 80/20 guideline isn't nearly nuanced enough as a prescription for any athlete; if put into a 3-domain or zone model, then 80/20/0 is completely different than 80/0/20, yet both are 80/20. Additionally, elites tend to do their easy runs ~1 mmol/L, not ~2 or 0.5 over baseline, so it's mostly semantics unless you subscribe to the \"zone 2\" ideas of Tadej Pogačar's fluffer(Inigo San Millán) , which I remain skeptical about until he actually defines it physiologically, instead of the whole thing being an ad for his coaching services. To his credit, Seiler's greater idea of \"keep easy, easy, keep hard, hard\" can be made to fit the Norwegian model with the simple addition of \"keep moderate, moderate\". I am not sure how well his ideas of polarization by session intention have held up over time and as others noted, he pulled back from this, but I digress.",

It also sounds like he was a 19 runner for a while so it wasn't like he was just passing through that marker. That would almost equate to a low 16 5k this 10 mile he supposedly run and probably on cusp of being a 15 runner. It just doesn't seem plausible on this kind of basic training. When I see something too good to be true, it usually is. Yes, I could accept it maybe if going from a 25 down to a 22. But returns will diminish sub 19 especially and to almost find 3 minutes when then doing zero speedwork or anything runners have done that we know works, well I just don't quite believe it. Maybe we are missing something we aren't being told? I can believe he stays healthy as this doesn't sound hard. It's easier than my training. I just don't believe it would make anyone fast.

Not to get too far off the rails with this. LT1 and \"the talk test\", which equates to being near VT1, is often taken as the surrogate for ISM's \"zone 2\" by his acolytes and it is generally accepted as the end of the moderate exercise domain. My point is that we shouldn't get too caught up in doing our easy runs near it, especially if the rest of the runs will be subthreshold/tempo because they are fairly close in terms of intensity. The issue becomes, \"Well then, how easy is easy?\" AFAIK, there are no real physiological anchor points below the first metabolic turn point we can use as a reference, zone 1 in a 5-zone model is 100% arbitrarily determined. It's somewhere at lactate baseline, below a ventilatory inflection point, etc. A percentage of a maximal anchor point like VO2max, HRmax, or Wmax doesn't tell us where our domains are in relation to it. % of CP or MLSS doesn't tell us where the first turn point is in relation to it. Maybe % of VT1, LT1, or GET could work, but I can't see that becoming too popular. That leaves subjective descriptors like RPE which aren't really that helpful and all of this says nothing as to what is the optimal easy intensity.",

To find MLSS you need a lactate meter. That does not mean a lactate measurement during or after a quality session or by a ramp test, is wrong. CV offers a performance indicator which is in my opinion easier to get, and you get an athlete profiling. And there we are, 10K pace is basically CV pace for Pro athletes but not for amateurs as they need longer to run a 10k.

So not 5k pace, but what you miss out in top end speed is made up for with much more volume at faster paces (you could easily clock 20km at HM pace and above in one week - no one is clocking 20km a week at 5km+ pace under traditional plans) 2) Running at or above VO2max is not the only way to stimulate improvements in VO2max. Whilst running at the paces specified may not be such an intense stimulus, they are easier to rack up volume and recover from so the loss of some stimulus is balanced out. I'm not the individual that prompted your comment, so I can't comment on their progression. As a cyclist though they did clock an 18:xx 10 mile TT before coming to running.

If they aren't elite, then their 5k time is above critical power and their 10k time is below it, so that would basically be their 'max targeted subthreshold' pace served to them on a platter. Unless they want to train/race exactly at threshold or use it as a metric to track their progress instead of race results, which are truly the gold standard measure of performance, then they probably think it's just a distracting academic matter. The functionality of it all is getting a bit lost. Putting aside how much the duration of the exercise impacts the intensity domains, which perhaps, is best measured in the field using a lactate meter towards the end of the session. They are too impractical to provide the constant data required for highly accurate training under normal training conditions. You wouldn't, for example, whip out a lactate meter while running up a mild hill just to check that you are not over an arbitrary lactate value. So let me make an argument for running power, or perhaps running velocity. For starters, running power is consistent enough to be used directly as an intensity gauge without getting into the whole debate about whether it's a true measure of power. It's much more responsive than HR. As shown in studies on Stryd, it can be used to derive CP/CV with good accuracy without doing specific time trials, provided there is enough variety in training data(outdoor or indoor). The derived threshold value can be kept up-to-date with no effort by the end user, without them doing any all-out efforts, races, or even anything at threshold. What I find interesting is that they're eventually going to be able to use stress scores, historic data, weather information, and a complex algorithm to account for all environmental conditions and, for the most part, the state of your body, in order to remove their impact on running power and velocity. You would be able to directly compare a cold, snowy, hilly run in a state of overreaching to a run on a flat surface in perfect weather with fresh legs. Take this all with a grain of salt because I actually haven't done much testing on this and I'm still a luddite. Most times the watch is at home or being plainly ignored until I look at the data after the run. I did try COROS' Effort Pace but it just managed to distract me since it's delayed by like 10–20 seconds, but in essence it's a customized Grade Adjusted Pace that tracks with power.",

Thus he's probably got a hell of an aerobic base (plus talent) to work from (think capillaries/mitochondria/heart etc), so the improvement is likely much larger/quicker than the run of the mill athlete can expect. Similarly, I saw Tom Domoulin cracked out a 32 min 10k the other day, not bad for a cyclist! In terms of rate of improvement, he's not alone benefiting from threshold interval focus, this year my hobby jogger partner (female mid 30s) has gone from 39 down to mid 36 for 10k (on a hot day!) typically averaging ~45-50 mpw, by doing threshold sessions twice per week, long run, plus strides with rare top end sessions sprinkled in, which sex-adjusted is probably a similar leap over a similar time frame. She does vary it a bit (eg has 1 rest day per week, sometimes makes the long run a progression, adds/replaces with the elliptical) but the two threshold sessions are the weekly staple. Can't persuade her to do 3 until she stops improving! As an aside, whilst there appears no fast work in sirpoc's training it's probably worth remembering he races 5k every 3 or 4 weeks which is a decent max stimulus. It may not work for everyone but this sort of training certainly works for some. If you're time limited and plateaued there's no harm in giving it a go. Personally I'd throw some strides in as well, but that's me.",

Then went back to what he did cycling which they call sweespot and performances rocket again after around 6-8 months of total plateau. I ask question and he's been mostly the same weight throughout, so this is just training gains. Like you said. Maybe once a month does a park run, which is some stimulation. But also a significant amount less by a large percentage of what other guys would do in terms of vo2 or speedwork , as nothing else is really faster than his 10 mile or hour pace, often quite a bit slower.

Main points of differences are I) that she has a rest day every week and typically does two sessions, instead often adds some intensity to the long run knowing the following day is a rest day. ii) And she adds some extra speed work (typically stride/uphill strides and efforts). On top of this she does strength and/or core 2-3 times per week. Most of her philosophy comes from the SWAP podcast which really emphasises repeatability/consistency/threshold/ strides. M : Rest T: 8x 3 mins uphill @sub-threshold (1 min downhill jog recovery) - nb. we have mountains which makes this possible. PM: 30 mins recovery elliptical W: 1hr z1 road run Th: 1hr Z1 + 5 x hill strides F: 4x2k @MP, 5x400 @cv (1 min). Pm 30 mins recovery elliptical Sat: 1hr Z2 Sun: 1hr 45 trail run - z1 30 mins of Z3 up climbs. M: Rest T: 10x1k @hm (1 min), pm: 30 mins recovery elliptical W: 1hr z1 trail run. Thurs: 1hr z1 road run F: 1h 10 with 5k @ MP, then 10x30s hill efforts to finish, Pm: 30 mins recovery elliptical Sat: 1hr z1 road run Sun: 1hr 45 long run with 7k of sub threshold efforts during it. Every so often she does a session like 10x (800@HM, 200@5k) with 90 s recovery to get a bit of faster work in. Additionally, every few months she does a 4 week base block of slightly volume (eg 60 mpw) of only easy running and strides. Personally I think the difficulty with the triple singles threshold approach is potentially it's simplicity/monotony/relentlessness - this will suit certain personality types better than others. For others you may need to be creative to keep it engaging (playing with the distances of reps, for example threshold pyramid to work a range of paces) or as above moving some of the effort into the long run, or doing one of the sessions as a fartlek on the trails using climbs to do the sub threshold work. The key is finding that balance where it's something you can repeat week after week accruing lots of time in this sub threshold state through the week. For me that's easy running with 2 sub-threshold sessions a week plus a fartlek fun run containing sub threshold sections, plus the odd stride session. Also I need a rest day as I'm injury prone. I'm committed to this till my goal race in December so will be interesting to see how it plays out.",

It's called zone 2 training, not zone 1, and the additional intensity comes at the expense of duration and thus the total time spent utilizing fat near fatmax for the vast majority of people. Either idea is contrary to a multitude of studies on HIIT showing that it can be very effective at improving fat oxidation ability, but if we are talking about changing our training solely because of this, then I think the minimum acceptable proof is at least an observational study where a low-intensity group is compared to a high-intensity group and not a study that is saying there is an inverse correlation between blood lactate and fat oxidation, which wasn't in dispute.

That intensity is typically above 50%VO2max give or take, which is around >60%HRmax for trained athletes. However, i fully agree with Seiler, that duration and intensity is interconnected. On the other side, the practical point is that a lot of hobby athletes train around 1h give or take (easy units). So we often assume that duration for easy running, without writing that down. In a 5 zone model, zone 2 is typically between 60-70%HRmax (for trained athletes=my default assumption). And that is the zone were e.g. i have within 1h, exactly zero increase of my lactate level above lactate baseline level. This is btw also the intensity description of sirpoc, for his 50min easy runs. For me, it is also very save to assume that also sirpoc does not increase his lactate level above his baseline. This range uses very little fast twitch fibers, and so they can recover better. This way he can train again hard on the next day, 48h recovery time for the fast twitch fibers is good and he sets the next training impulse. That easy pace is the fundament here. So at the end of the day an easy unit shall not be seen isolated. As i discussed with sirpoc, a training unit just below 2mmol is not the same effort as a unit in zone 2 (see my above description), for the same duration. Putting that in the same zone as Sailer did, was a big mistake, as mentioned.",

Beyond that the more intense an exercise is, the longer the recovery, and the higher the proportion of type II fibers used- not something being questioned. My take is that easy runs should be as intense as to not impede any other session or defeat their purpose, but that's as far as I will go without hard evidence. Maybe for you and your time schedule, that means training at lactate baseline, but I think we should be weary of any element of cargo cultism and confirmation bias just because a gentleman has found success. It seems a bit ridiculous to measure lactate at the end of an easy 1-hour session to make sure it's under an arbitrary amount when the actual boundary of the moderate-to-heavy domain is unclear and could be above baseline or even above LT1.

    "message": "I thought about your question since you posted it, as my situation is similar (45 runs since beginning of August, after a decade of almost none). My observation is: An intensity of 5k every month is irrelevant IF the easy runs are run easy. One member of the Strava group recently ran an easy run as low as 60%HFmax which caught my attention and is a shining 🌟 example for me. So my answer is: You are worrying about the wrong aspect. Rather: Embrace the \"group spirit\" of this thread and focus on the majority of sessions and their efforts : The easy run . I re-read this thread 2 times with the focus on the shared knowledge about - easy runs - cautious addition of mileage Following this guidance finally brings me close to the 50th session, after several failed attempts in the last years to pick up running again (got injured real quick when I tried). I could easily handle a 5k every month, but don't need it to determine my paces: Training results are obvious and I adjust (conservatively) by training results. I ran one 5000m, more a reward than an enlightening about paces. And I am looking forward to a cross-country run and it's atmosphere. Pinning a bib, hooray! But training paces: I don't need the race for that. When I head out for an easy run I have this very conscious thought: Let's 🚫 not use any fiber that shall fast-twitch tomorrow! ;) And I go to the lake where the joggers are and trail one of them (with a distance). I should have understood that 20years ago.",

It's fun. 2. Gives me a reason to train. I don't enter many proper races, so it keeps my motivation higher on a lot of these boring training runs. 3. It's really easy for me to then know where I'm at, then adjust my paces without having to buy more lactate strips. I've spot tested this approach now and again to lactate, and for me, I'm confident in its accuracy. 4. It does give me a small amount of \"harder\" work. I have gone about 10 weeks with no racing I think before, or something long like that. My improvement in that period was the same. So how much this helps is totally up for debate. Note, the reverse of point 3 applies here, my training tells me almost certainly when I'm going good and 90% of the time translates into a PB in the 5k. So I guess I'm picking when I run my 5ks, it tends to be when I feel I have stepped it up, which in turn happens to be every 4-5 weeks. Final note, now the winter is here (like last year) I'll probably race park run less. I'm glad people are still finding a good thread useful, I'll try to keep and eye on it a bit more. Although the Strava group is pretty busy, not everyone I am guessing is on there. I'm still hilariously baffled that anyone would find my Strava interesting. It's nice to have other runners that I follow now though, not just cyclists. Maybe I'll actually be a runner first and cyclist second, soon. Who'd have thought it , ha ha .",

This is a known problem with graded exercise tests, not only are there so many different variables in terms of step duration, rest periods, etc., there are at least 25 different methods to calculate lactate threshold and nearly all of them are invalid, with OBLA (4 mmol/l) as the most notable example. This is why maximal lactate steady state tests were considered the gold standard before critical power, they're much less variable, but there are still some protocol issues not yet fully addressed, as previously mentioned. So you have a lactate meter, right? You can take your 10k pace and run for 30 minutes at a constant speed. If the measurement at 15 or 20 minutes (using these points seems to have the closest agreement with critical power without the intensity being adjusted on the fly) is ≤1 mmol from the measurement at 30 minutes, then you are at or near your MLSS. You can increase or decrease the speed as required and take the test again on a different day to hone it in, but such fine-grained information isn't really useful. What is useful is knowing your approximate MLSSv (velocity) and MLSSw (watts) so you can use it in training to ensure you are below threshold without poking yourself and wasting lactate strips if you think that is of benefit.",

It was expected that training more in the severe domain would lead to a greater increase in VO2peak, and it did by ~2.5 mL/kg/min, but surprisingly, there was zero difference in time trial performance or peak power. If true and confirmed by research with a larger sample size, this could be quite groundbreaking. The implication is that an improvement in something like lactate threshold or mechanical efficiency is offsetting a lower VO2max, which is also often the first thing to peak in elites so it could be a sign they should focus on more heavy domain intensity vs. polarized. I will add the cavate that this would matter more for half and full marathoners who race below threshold. In my estimation, 5k and elite 10k runners should probably still do some training near race pace to get them used to high exertion, drive motor unit recruitment, build W'/D' capacity for kicking or overtaking, etc., but none of that is exactly necessary just to beat the other guys at the Parkrun.

Whereas what sirpoc84 has done is really make one of the best starter guides for hobby joggers who are a bit stuck on progress, that I have seen, possibly ever. Someone suggested crib notes of something a couple of months back, but I'm actually all for the audio format where we can listen back to it a couple of times if needed. I'm sure there are others who read this thread properly, where light bulbs went off. So come on podders, someone pin him down and get him on. On another note, as someone who is in the Strava group, that's also lovely to see other people from this thread now having success with this approach. I've started to think about how I can apply this to my athletes for the coming season, so I will hopefully come back and report on that down the line!",

I didn't conclude anything, I'm not a statistician, I quoted the authors almost verbatim and then made clear the need for a larger sample size before confirmation. Jem Arnold, one of the authors said, and I quote directly \"there was NO difference\", the paper concluded \"No significant difference related to the intensity of training was observed for Wpeak or TT performance\". You should contact them if you want a retraction based on it possibly being a statistical artifact despite that the heterogeneity was low. While we are being pedantic, can we adopt MMSS (maximal metabolic steady state) instead of MLSS as they did unless we are directly talking about a MLSS test? There is much more going on at threshold than lactate still being in a quasi-steady state, and it's past time we got away from the old-school notion of lactate acidosis leading to exercise termination.",

I don't want to put words into his mouth, but the jist of it is he felt tired all the time and the vo2 stuff on top of the tempo straight was really putting him in a spiral a lot of us also have found ourselves in before. With this new approach, for well over a year, the improvement started again and hasn't stopped, carefully ramping up the load that probably isn't quite as possible to control Daniels style in my opinion. We aren't talking a little improvement. He was likely not even gonna break 65 minutes a year or so ago when the brick wall was hit, for 10 miles. Now he's ran a very low 56 .

TSS and CTL is something I have become very interested in and can't believe I didn't use it before. It's really helping me shape my own training coach free. If you are an older runner I genuinely believe this might be the best system you can hope for. It's at least worth a try for everyone who's older and maybe looking to limit the pain the really fast stuff brings.",

    "message": "dutch_in_uk, nwsa, and whoever else is interested... hope this is what you're after. Keeping with Daniels approach of equalizing effort based on duration (not distance), I put this together. The values you see listed under the interval duration at the different paces is meters run at the respective pace. So, based on your VDOT level, you can choose to run for the duration of time at that pace or settle on an interval distance that is around what running for that duration of time would produce (i.e. if your VDOT is 50, instead of running for 8 minutes at 4:20 per km, which would be 1,845 meters, you can choose to go a little less and do a 1600m or go a little more and do a 2000m repeat). In addition, if you want to use paces based on race distances, I put together two additional tables. One with race times for the distances of interests referred to on this thread and another which lists the paces for those distances. This could also be used for running a time trial and then assigning/updating paces based on your performance.",

    "message": "The idea behind breaking-up the SubT work as opposed to doing a continuous tempo run is that you can control the lactate better and you can run faster paces because you have breaks. As has been discussed several times throughout the thread, SubT is a state and the pace will vary based on the length of the rep. So 400s can be faster than 1,000s, which are faster than miles, etc. Using this logic, you would need to slow down even more for a continuous tempo. Drew Bosley posts most of his training on Strava. He is often doing reps on the track at 4:48 pace and continuous subT at Buffalo Park 20ish seconds per mile slower. Not a perfect comparison, since Buffalo Park is a slower surface than the track, but somewhere in the 10-15s per mile might be right. I’d be curious to hear what others think. The problem with doing long tempos is that most people lack the discipline to keep things under control. The tempo turns into a time trial. They’re not working the appropriate system. By using repetitions with breaks, you’re less likely to overcook it.",

(Q = quality, i.e., sub-threshold). Sub-threshold work should comprise 20-25% (MAYBE 30%) of total time spent running during the week. So if you run 50mpw in 7 hours, you should run a total of 84-105 mins of sub-threshold per week, or or 28-35 minutes per session. Sub-threshold is a STATE not a pace. For trained runners, if LT2 threshold is 4.0-4.5mmol, a sub-threshold session should aim to reach ~2.5-3.5mmol measured at the end of the last rep. You don't necessarily need a lactate test / lactate meter if you generally follow the paces below. But in my personal experience, I would say when first starting out, to run a bit slower than the below, as it seems that when you are adjusting to the volume, lactate can run a little higher. Reaching sub-threshold can be done with a virtually unlimited combination of interval distances, paces, and rest periods. The most common are: Or in terms of time-based intervals, the most common are: Looks like some people do 400m / 1 minute reps with 30\" rest at 10K pace occasionally as well. Rest can be standing, walking, or jogging - goal is to just keep the rest short to maintain lactate state. On easy runs, keep them extremely EASY. Absolutely no higher than 65% of MAS (your max pace you can hold for 6 minutes) or 70% of max heart rate. No need to do VO2max or harder \"x-factor\" workouts (e.g., hills) until you stop progressing on this method. Would note, sirpoc does a 5K parkrun race every 4-5 weeks, so he might be getting some stimulus from that. But he noted he has gone 10 weeks without racing and still had big PBs after. The main hypothesis behind this method is that you can accumulate significantly more training stress (measured by pace-based TSS) over a given period of time vs. a traditional Daniels approach (track workout, tempo, long run), with the same or less fatigue / injury risk. The key is to always err on the slower side and not go over your LT threshold (even when feeling good) as that leads to disproportionate fatigue for the training stress, and can very quickly build up and leave you trashed. Sirpoc (the key poster in this thread) has shown over the course of several months that this method has consistently produced very impressive PBs. To be fair, he is an N of 1. I am personally giving this method a try and will report back. Hope that summarizes it.",

Maybe this shows you where the limit is before you need to ice the cake , as KI has added in some risk now with the really heavy stuff. A caveat to that, is 99% of hobby joggers would love to get to where sirpoc and KI are, on purely singles running and living a normal life. My view is most of us could run for an hour a day like they do, if they wanted. The extra note, is whilst not everyone is doing this exactly as laid out on Strava, in the Norwegian singles group, there's many following the spirit of this approach and getting PBs.

His method was also inspired by the 'style' running of the 1930s [7] in that he never used a stop watch but regarded his runners intensely and broke up the set of intervals when the described speed (e.g. 'good swing tempo') could no longer be run as relaxed as demanded [8] YAP YAP YAP I DONT CARE DO YOU TAKE EBT??",

    "message": "I just thought I would update the thread with a few things. One thing I will add to the excellent post by \"summary\" on the previous page, is I am NOT saying this is the way you must train or the only way to train. Maybe in the middle of the pages, what has got lost is the CTL and TSS talk (I think I explained it reasonably well, as quite a few people I speak to regularly are using it?). What I have always said and maintain - this being the key point; is that if you are correctly tracking your data, daily TSS and CTL , there's a good chance that you will be fitter/faster , the higher it goes, pretty much no matter HOW you get there. My example before was when I was injured on the bike, I did the turbo trainer for an insane amount of time day after day, raised my CTL to record heights and did a power PB with a healed collarbone a few weeks later. This was purely zone 1/2 riding. But the point being with sub threshold, it's the easiest/quickest way to get a high CTL (fitness score for those not using intervals icu, same thing) being time crunched and without the extra injury risk the real hard stuff brings (as well as the relative extra recovery needed). I could get the same CTL riding sweetspot, in around half the time I did with all that easy riding and my power the next year was almost identical. I just thought I would add that, as I think that is being lost a bit. I stick by my initial posts on paces (Hard2find I think has provided an amazing resource) but this isn't the only way to train. A big \"if\" but if my body could handle a Daniels schedule on more hours I'm doing now (spoiler, it likely can't) , then I would probably get faster . FWIW , I'll put this out there, stuff I have shared with jiggy, Hard2find and shirtboy, is that since my CTL was \"50\" (that was as high as I could get it a more classic style) by pb at 5k has roughly gone up 8 seconds, for every extra CTL point. It's not perfectly near, but there is a clear pattern and trend. Final note on that, I'm also working on the assumption for running, as it was on the bike it didn't really matter HOW I increased my training load, each CTL point was worth about 1.5w in FTP, up to the point I literally couldn't fit anymore into my lifestyle. Anyway, I don't get a huge amount of time at the moment to contribute to this thread as much as I want, but hopefully some of your find that interesting and just to clear up I'm not saying this is the way you HAVE to train, but I still say based on the experience from both sports and seeing what others are doing, it's likely going to get you there in the most time efficient way.",

Is 185 bpm still under threshold, what about 190 bpm? How isn't that completely arbitrary? What if I want to run for 1 hour and I'll have more drift? How is that any better than RPE if not substantially worse? It's stupid to think that RPE can even be dissociated from anything when it's how we run before anything else. It doesn't matter what I tell you your critical power is, if you don't feel like you can manage it, you won't.

One of the reasons that he started doing this was because the vast majority of people have a terrible idea of what threshold is meant to feel like. RPE has not heard-up. Whenever freshman or transfers would come in, using RPE for their entire running careers previously, they always overestimated threshold. Every single time without fail. The point isn’t to use HR as the only metric. HR and blood lactate testing help you dial in RPE. After a few tests you can use HR as a guide. It really helps you dial in the effort. I now live in an area with a lot of sub-elite runners. None of them use HR or have tested their blood. They all go off RPE. They swear it feels easy. You’d think they’d all be running at the marathon trials in a few months based on their workout times. In reality, they’re several, several minutes slower.

It's sad to witness that the vast majority of runners are proudly 20-30 years behind the times and refuse to change. Even Joe Friel in 2009 required that his triathletes use power and pace as a guide instead of just using HR because he recognized the problems it has.

It’s nothing to do with cardiac drift, it’s a over estimation of fitness or poor training for marathon distance.

Then stay under that or percentage point over when training. This is the point of this thread, as much work at sub threshold pace as you can handle and keep improving. Using critical power, or speed, or heart rate, or lactate for what you have, it’s ballpark only.

The same uptick in the first stages of the race was found in the group of runners who ran a negative split, and contrary to some of the claims made in this thread, it does happen over short durations, especially in warm weather. As per a study on it: \"Cardiovascular drift, the progressive increase in heart rate and decrease in stroke volume that begins after approximately 10 min of prolonged moderate-intensity exercise\" Most watches now have running power and I find it to be very consistent. There's also grade adjust pace so critical pace can be made useful for hilly areas. HR is the worst tool anyone has access to, even if they don't have any other tools. LTHR itself is an unnecessary overcomplication yet no one wagged their finger at the person talking about how to find it, just my suggestion that he instead use something else. Can you guys at least have the moral consistency to call out everyone else 'overcomplicating things' rather than just what you disagree with?

But you can probably use it, again for a ball park. But it's really quite poor, when you compare it to the consistency you can get from a running power meter.

This comes from someone who is desperate to train by power, but it's just not quite good enough yet to be my main go to, especially on the fly. Afterwards, data can be smoothed out in golden cheetah, but this obviously doesn't help during the session. The other huge advantage of just picking one metric, is your training load is hugely trackable and it can help you 1. Predict performance but 2. Also know when to increase training load. Your CTL will be as accurate as a hobby jogger needs, using your same metric to calculate daily training load.

While it’s not measuring what YOU think is important, its measurements are repeatable and correlates over 0.9 R-square with VO2 (from my own data). For the point of this thread, Stryd would be my primary tool to control intensity. But I’ve been using Stryd and cycling power for a while and understand things conceptually.",

    "message": "These two studies had a total of 30 participants. one had 10 one had 20. Of the one that had 20, they could not even do all the tests because of COVID, but still made conclusions nonetheless. From the second article: \"A major limitation from our study was that COVID restrictions prevented a single time trial. Thus, for our outdoor trials, participants encountered varying running conditions that we are unable to control for such as different weather, temperature and courses. Nevertheless, even with this limitation, CPSTRYD was highly predictive of outdoor performance. It must also be noted that our runners could not have feasibility raced one another in any meaningful way. Even a 1500 m track based time trail would result in some participants being lapped more than once. We believe this heterogeneity of our population can also be considered a strength as runners are not a homogenous group and running power will appeal to many runners of different abilities. Predictive measures such as VO2peak are more predictive of performance in heterogenous populations [33]. A homogenous group such as elite runners would be likely to generate weaker relationships with Stryd than we have found. This also warrants further research. One possible limitation is that we did not determine MLSS and this also would be one area for further research. Also, a possible limitation is that while CPSTRYD was statistically equivalent to CPCALC, some participants recorded differences between the two estimates. Coaches and runners need to remain aware that CP estimates are highly influenced by both trial protocols and the mathematical models employed [15]. Even when using the same protocol and model a ~5% day to day variance should be expected\" So a 5% variation day to day is expected between a normal CP estimate and the Stryd algo, but you think HR is very unreliable?",

    "message": "The problem with the Stryd seems to be it assumes or has programmed in what your CDA likely is, based on your height and weight. Whilst I'm sure, there's less varied frontal dynamics in running over cycling, it still poses a huge issue. For me, when I'm running into the wind at pretty much the same effort as with the tailwind, the reading is different. Say 275w versus 325w. Whereas on a bike it would obviously read 300w both ways. The issue being, you can't say it averages out, as you will be running into the wind, for longer than the tailwind, so even over say 1k in each direction, your data is flawed. Maybe I'm missing something, but I don't see any way to change this. Whereas with a cycling power meter, this isn't an issue. It has no idea or anything other than the force going through the cranks or pedals (depending on what meter you have). In fact, you can actually then do the opposite, which is calculate your CDA based on power, versus conditions , wind, crr, etc. so it's actually really useful and obviously repeatable. The issue with my wrist power, is ironically it seems to be better at into the wind versus out of the wind. But it's incredibly reliable on the watches elevation data. My Garmin, sometimes spikes in elevation. Which obviously is a huge issue, as suddenly you are doing 500w. You can smooth the data out in golden cheetah after (which I've done) but ultimately, on the go it makes the readings useless, or at best no better than HR or pace. It's unfortunate, nothing is ideal and I wish power is better. This is coming from someone who used exclusively power for cycling, to the point I didn't use any heart rate data for about 5 years. But the usability for it for running, that whilst fun and interesting to play with (I've collected so much data), I wouldn't be making it my primary tool, as much as I want to. HR for me is a decent tool, as the conditions I run in are neither too extreme either way. Whilst pace is great, as I live in a totally flat area.",

I will state again, I ONLY used a power meter for 5+ years at the end of my life as a cyclist, so I didn't even bother with a heart rate monitor or even own one at that point after it broke. This is the best way to think of it. The Stryd is pretty much useless for me, compared to pace or HR. I choose pace, as it's probably the best to replicate my running, which is all outside in an absolutely pan flat area. Some weeks I can do 90km and only 200m of elevation over the whole week. They won't mind me mentioning them I hope, but Shirtboy for example, probably for him the best metric he knows and can guage based on his circumstances is HR. For Jiggy, based on his circumstances actually lactate testing is probably best to shape or spot check sessions, due to his extreme climate (then to pick one of the other metrics, to shape TSS per session to compliment). There's nothing wrong with that, we literally can work with that. That's 3 people, in different parts of the world, but we are all roughly doing the same thing who feel this is working. If, we were all riding our bikes, we could probably all do our riding inside (or most of it, it's obviously more efficient use of time) and almost certainly, power would be the best metric for us all to use, simply because across the board, it's going to be totally consistent. We could all use 3 different power meters in this pretend world, which would potentially all read different (250w isn't necessarily 250 actual watts) but the principle stands, that individual power meter is highly repeatable for us and you can really dial it in. I just cannot do that with a Stryd. It might work with some, but it just won't for me. So it's not the blanket solution here . Yet. I hope that changes. As it would make things way easier for me to apply basically what I have done for all those years on the bike, to running.",

You can also do a multi day protocol if side-effects are a concern. What I disagree with is that price is beyond the point of discussion when there is opportunity cost compared to trying regular ass baking soda.

To be clear though, sufficient wind force would impact velocity and thus running power but it probably doesn't greatly impact the accuracy of the calculation of Stryd's critical power model since that would be averaged out in the mass of data they collect. I believe that means you would really only have to worry about it in fairly windy conditions if you were using it as a measure of intensity and then trying to train exactly at your critical power without RPE as the deciding factor. The same issue applies to using pace. Anyway, I don't think my watch uses either the barometer or weather reports to try to take wind into account but I've been using running power for weeks and found it to be very consistent across different conditions and grades all the same. I'm more interested in tracking average power sustained over a certain distance so I can then see how I'm improving over time or if I'm getting too fatigued, without running time trials or needing to go back and do the same course.",

So if you have headwind and you keep your pace, you need more power to run forward. Power value increases, but the speed is the same. The opposite is true with tailwind, if you keep your speed constant. Therefore power is better as speed in theory, leaving the measurment problems of a food pod aside for a moment. In cycling you train by power, and if you catch some headwind you keep the power, but by doing so your speed gets slower. Hope my englisch was good enough to explain it in an understandable way :)",

    "message": "Lexel, maybe I explained it not great myself, that's not the issue. I can run at the same effort (power) but the power displayed isn't the same. That's because the Stryd in the wind, doesn't calculate my CDA correctly. If there was zero wind, it works fine. If my cda fitted into the algorithm, it would work fine. My frontal area is obviously less, than it predicts for my height versus weight. My effort is the same both ways , it should be 300w both ways (just to use an example), no matter what my speed is, but it just doeskt work out like that. I can run at HM effort which I have dialed in, and it'll widely vary both ways, even though the effort (not pace) is basically the same. This is easily replicated with force, like a cycling power meter of course. But the Stryd isn't measuring any force. It's using velocity, acceleration , terrain, wind to estimate what the force would be. But the issue is, it needs an extra calculation that a cycling power meter doesn't, it requires to guess or estimate what the users frontal area will be or is. I simply don't fit into this. I would guess I have narrow shoulders for my size, as my cda recorded on a bike is incredibly low, like 0.14 with crr taking into consideration. I've used aerolab in golden cheetah to test this on the bike, so my assumption is reasonable I think that I'm also more narrow than what stryd thinks the average person for my weight and height is. (again, this is a huge advantage of a power meter on the bike, you can actually use it to test aerodynamics and which equipment is faster, but that's just an aside, not the issue here, but another example of why measuring force through the cranks or pedals, is superior). This isn't a massive issue, it's just another tool anyway for now running power. Obviously having 10 years of cycling power data, running to power would be great. But we just aren't there yet. The wrist sensor on the Garmin seems better, in the sense I think it's probably estimating a lower cda, that works better for me for the same HM pace effort both ways (although it reads 400w, who cares about the actual numbers). The main issue being, the elevation spikes wreck the data when running live. But that's now the power algorithms fault, it's the actual watched elevation data.",

You could also just do 20 mins or an hour . That also works. It doesn't really matter, as long as you stick to the same way you calculate FTP each time. It's only useful to you anyway, not anyone else. This is despite the many arguments people have gotten into with coggan over the years.

    "message": "Hopefully as we have really gone in deep on this, some people might find this interesting. So for my normal schedule, over 6 weeks, I ran with the wrist paced power set up, linked to my nearest weather station 1 minute before I started the run and pressed start on the Garmin. This was a mixture of easy runs, long easy runs, 10x1k , 6x 1600 and 3x 3200. My FTP was set up with the assumption ( this is what I will continue to use) that a 5k is equivalent to a 10 mile TT or 20 mins and that 94% of that will suffice. It's not my real FTP, it's just a guess like anyone really but that is going to be my protocol from now until the end of time. For what it's worth, I always used this when cycling and my 10 mile PB is near 18 min flat and my 5k is around 17 mind flat. So in terms of aerobic effort, they are very close. We can argue on the 94%. If coggan was here, he would argue. But I've known plenty of people use this and it works over time. FTP is only relevant to me and the only thing I consider important really is it's in the range of realistic and highly repeatable in how I work it out. Anyway, onto the data. So all my runs are either giant loops, or out and back repeats with an even number of runs into the wind and back or vice versa. I thought I would add that in. So here is the huge issue. The watch based power, requires elevation in its calculations. Whilst that is usually accurate, as part of this testing I recalibrated manually before the start of each run. However every now and again there might be a random 5 foot spike up or down ( just as an example) despite clearly me being on a flat, sea level plain with literally the sea at eye level to my left or right, during the run. So you would get a huge spike (or decrease) in power for a short duration, if you were looking at the power gauge in real time. This would obviously completely skew the data, over say a relatively short 1km repeat. However, the caveat to that, is when it measured the elevation as pan flat, say picking HM effort (not pace) as the example, it measured the power VERY accurately both ways, compared to the styrd. So it must accept my frontal area as less. Again, this must be factored into the equation, as it has no actual idea of the force being applied. So the \"power\" number is just an approximation of a giant algorithm, rather than a mechanical measurement. Note, if anyone ever tried the Cyclops \"chest\" based cycling power meter about 10 years ago, it reminds me slightly of this. Sometimes it plays ball, sometimes it doesn't. Ok, so the problem. How to deal with the spikes. What I did was load all my runs into golden cheetah and use the editing software to flatten out the spikes in elevation/ power That's when things became much more interesting and usable. All easy runs then fitted neatly into between 76-79% of FTP. All 1k repeats were within 102- 103% of FTP. All 1600 repeats were within 99- 100% of actual FTP . And 3200 repeats were within 96- 97% of FTP. This suddenly is incredibly useful information on a narrow range that is working for me. The pace was a bit scattered, so in this sense power is a much more useful and narrow margin of error metric to use. Ok, so the big problem. I had to smooth out all those power spikes. It had zero use to me on the go or in the session in real time. Sometimes, before the data was smoothed out, there could have been 20w difference between workouts of the same duration. So on the go, really I would have no idea where I am. Anyway, I found it incredibly helpful to look back in retrospect. It's just such a shame, there is no way to see it with this accuracy in real time. A final note, these are \"harder\" than cycling sweetspot zones. But the final say on that, cycling sweetspot you might do 3x 15 or 3x 20, so in a lesser percentage of FTP range, (96% was the lowest I did in running) which is offset by the longer reps and for a longer amount of time. Whereas in my running, they are shorter but a little bit harder, even the 3ks are probably 5 mins shorter than any sweetspot reps I would do on the bike (where I would target maybe 89- 93% of FTP).",

On my 2k reps I’ve been doing 2 min rest instead of one and feel it just gives more opportunity to stay aerobic. But I think my heart rate probably takes longer to come down then a lot of you guys.

    "message": "To sirpoc, shirtboy, or any of the others who've adopted this system and have a solid understanding of it: I'm wondering if since the system is based on time for the longer efforts (3-minute and 6-minute intervals), would it make sense to shoot for 1-1.5-minute intervals in place of the 400m intervals? I ask because it seems like the amount of time spent at the appropriate pace puts all runners in a similar lactate state, whereas if a slower runner has to spend 90 seconds covering 400m, for example, doing 20 reps is going to tax them a bit more than Jakob, or one of the guys running a 17:00 5k. It seems to me that if you're running at the appropriate pace for a given interval, running for longer just to reach a specific distance means more time than others spent at a given level of threshold, and thus a higher lactate mmol value. The faster you are, the less time you'll spend at any given pace, and I've just been thinking that since time is the factor with the longer distances, maybe that should be the goal for all paces. I do understand that many have come to view 6-minute intervals as circa 2000m, and 3-minute intervals as circa 1000m, but looking into the Norwegian training, they seem to emphasize time over distance, except for the shorter 400m intervals and hills. Alternatively, of course, a slower runner could stick with the 1000m or 2000m distances, and just do fewer reps. I'm wondering what all of your thoughts are on this.",

I figure as my race times improve, the distances I travel in the allotted time of each interval will naturally increase. But for the 400m intervals, I definitely like the idea of considering the 90-second interval as an alternative to the 60-or-so seconds most faster guys probably cover in 400m. Interesting to know that sirpoc has stopped doin the 400m intervals. I will definitely take this into consideration, as injury prevention is my number one aim. So maybe I should be looking at the 3-minute 6-minute, and 8-to-12-minute intervals if that is working best for folks. As a former sprinter and college football player, I've definitely been a bit more fast-twitch my entire life (50.2 400m, 21.9 200m, 10.7 100m PR's). I've seen it recommended by folks like Malmo that those with more sprinting prowess stick to shorter reps, but not sure if I should be applying that concept to this workout. That's what interests me in the shorter reps, especially as I'm only currently looking at 5k and 10k races. But it seems that staying away from shorter reps isn't hurting anyone following these Norwegian-style plans, and the race times are phenomenal!",

Of course, specific mileage and pacing is largely dependent on where the specific athlete is in their fitness, cycle, etc.. Does anyone take this approach when structuring their sessions?

    "message": "Hey Curious1. I recently spoke with sirpoc84 about the TSS score range and his thoughts. He and I have both been seeing a range of about 75-85 TSS, but my workouts included 3.25 miles of easy running (1.75 warmup and 1.5 cool-down), so too much of the load was coming from easy running. I'm going to be doing 1.25 miles for warmup and 1 mile for cool-down moving forward, and adjust interval time/distance in order to find the combo that puts me in that 75-85 TSS per workout range. I just ran a 5k trial yesterday and PR'd, so I'll be working with updated and faster paces, which is why I want to start with 30 minutes of intervals each workout and hopefully move toward 36 minutes per workout. I figure if my fitness improves as I use my new paces, I'll naturally need to add reps, time, or distance in order to achieve a similar TSS score for the same pace. I'd started to run faster paces this past week due to not hitting the right % of threshold HR, which prompted me to do a 5k trial. But I will never again increase the pace without getting a new 5k trial PR, and will instead add time, distance, or reps. I'm gonna start sticking to paces based on threshold pace from a VDOT or other Daniels-style calculator instead of max HR during an interval rep. So, I'll be using the 75-85 TSS score to assess whether I'm going too easy or too hard. My HR just seems to go all over the place to trust it as the primary metric, but I'll certainly be checking it at the end of reps just to be sure I'm not going over the HR threshold. But I really am starting to believe that using a recent time trial to calculate threshold pace, using updated paces based on that time trial, monitoring TSS, and possibly grabbing a lactate meter will be the best way forward. In lieu of a lactate meter, I'll rely more on recent trial or race PR, updated paces, and 75-85 TSS as my guiding light. I'm also hoping that if I hit 85 TSS one day, that I stay below that on the other two days to get a 3-workout average closer to 75-80 TSS. I know, I went way off topic, but I hope some of what I've said here helps.",

I still have so much to figure out, such as identifying key workouts of the bunch. On one hand, I've seen folks mention the importance of focusing on strengths, such that a former sprinter (aka me) might get more out of the 1k/3-minute reps vs the 3k/10-minute reps. On the other hand, I've seen it mentioned that focusing on your weakness might be the key, so that I would flip the previous scenario and focus more on the longer intervals to build aerobic fitness a bit more. Because I'm unsure which approach is wiser, I've opted to just cycle between 3-min, 6-min, and 10-min reps, and have enjoyed them all. Definitely keeps things from being to mundane. Due to my lack of 5k speed, I don't hit 1k/2k/3k for these reps, and thus time is my focus. I don't enjoy the treadmill at all, but maybe it'll be okay for workouts since I find the faster speeds more enjoyable. Easy runs on the treadmill are the worst, and I always feel like I'm moving faster for a given pace than I am outdoors. But yeah, in these brutal southern summers, paces come way down, and that can be terrible for consistency. I am certainly enjoying the weather lately!",

Jakob and his brothers aren't just world class because of talent, they took an engineering approach to mid-long distance running. It comes down to some pretty basic principles of just a lot of threshold work and lots of easy running. You need to understand why you're running the workouts. You can go and hypothetically kill yourself in all your workouts, but what are you actually training? Doing crazy fast repeats will only give you marginal vo2 max benefits and form benefits. To actually get fast you need to be training the sub LT2 zone whilst keeping the easy runs aerobic enough to recover and benefit from the training. This zone is trainable. Personally I'm quite a bit faster than 1:15 so always try to be careful about talking about how easy it is to run certain times as a lot of people get caught up on the 'talent' aspect and how they will never be able to do something. But I think if you train your whole life to break 1:15 and can't do it then you are just not training properly. From your comment it seems like you are doing your easy runs way too fast, and maybe your hard runs way too hard also? I would recommend that you take the next 6 months to copy his running plan, but you need to make sure that you get the effort levels right.

    "message": "A lot of it has already been covered. But I haven't posted in a while so I will over my morning coffee. Firstly, I find it hilarious people think I might be secretly doing some \"special\" work, as if I would come on a niche internet forum to lie about it ha ha. No, just 4x easy (including easy \"long\") and 3x sub threshold, with the odd parkrun thrown in to keep me honest, see how/if I've improved and just to stop myself getting bored. It's very boring, I've seen that mentioned. But I enjoy getting better, this is the best way , I believe, for most people to get better. I was cycling roughly like this 10 years ago. So after a bit of disappointment messing around with Daniels style, this is where I am at. Someone also mentioned consistency. Absolutely spot on. I've said before, if I wanted to get fit in maybe 8 weeks, this is probably the worse way to train. But if you don't have a specific distance in mind from 5k (maybe less, I haven't tried) through HM, it's a really good generalised plan, with little risk. But you really do have to think long term. Miracles aren't going to happen overnight. As I said, if you maybe only have 6-8 weeks, roll the dice and do a more aggressive plan and see what happens. But if you are thinking 6+ months, then this in my opinion, is the best go to. On the subject of talent, I don't think I'm especially talented. I have no evidence of that particularly. But I do know I have zero natural speed. It was the same on the bike. I could train myself to go from untrained on the bike to 320w FTP at a pretty light weight, but my max 5 seconds power was like 750w pretty much no matter what I did (trained or untrained). It's the same with running, I can pretty much fill the distances in between 5k -hm on predicted pace, but I doubt I could run 600-800m at what now my 1500m pace comes out at. In fact, I know I can't. But , the good news as someone mentioned , threshold is easily trainable, it seems. On top of that, managing training loads etc happens to work really well (if done correctly) around these paces. So if you stick to it, I would say more people than not, will make the big gains long term. Final thing, FWIW, I think the best gauge of talent was when you were a kid. Here in the UK we run cross country as almost a punishment in PE at school. I wasn't over weight as a kid, played football, but wasn't great in these races. Worth remembering I think those \"races\" are a good talent spotter, as nobody ran or trained (like nobody at that age here) and I used to finish just under halfway in the field, maybe 70 out of 120 would be a normal result for me. Anecdotal, but indicates I was never even remotely spotted or picked up like the faster kids were to maybe taken their running further and actually train. I wasn't fat or anything really when I started running 2.5 years ago and suddenly was a sub 20 runner on little training. It took a while to get there and even for a lot of months I was slow, doing 5k time trials in maybe 24 ish. It took me a while to get sub 20 and then just as long again to grind myself down further. Anyway, good to see some life into this thread, still going strong!",

For the fast twitch athlete (okay, I’ll bite) it might be better to do 2x sub threshold and replace the third sub threshold with hills. In my experience, middle distance runners struggle with fatigue from threshold work because they do it way too fast. They’re more speed based, so threshold feels slow to them, and they run it too fast. They probably are disproportionately under trained aerobically, and their threshold is slower than expected.",

Along with very easy easy runs, and shorter/slower long runs than a slow twitch athlete would do. Which sounds suspiciously a lot like this approach - which is sub threshold in terms of net stimulus, not threshod, even if the interval pace is at or above threshold pace. The interval aspect probably makes it even easier for a FT person to do than marathon effort tempos etc as well. Probably not by accident either, if it was mostly developed for 1500-5k runners. Which maybe you wouldn't consider pure fast twitch, but they definitely have some wheels, unlike sirpoc who does seem to be more classic ST and aerobically talented given his success in cycling. It probably matters what the target event is too. No matter how good of a sprinter you are, if your goal is to run a fast marathon you better get some practice running moderately fast for a long time, cause that's exactly what the race will be.",

If you’re sub elite, then your physiology is probably not optimized for that. Idk how sub-elite we are talking here but it’s just so far into the weeds. I think we’re splitting hairs. I just don’t think it matters all that much. You could also argue that this sub-elite sprinter doesn’t have the physiology to be good at the marathon no matter how they train and they will always get beat by their slow twitch competitors and will never be a good age grouper. The whole point of this thread is to keep things simple. Talking about muscle type is definitely complicating things. David Roche, of Some Work All Play, mentions on his podcast often that he is fast twitch. He used to be a football player. He runs ultras now. His training isn’t really different than what most ultra runners do. He talks about how he has gradually shifted his physiology over time. I don’t know nearly enough about exercise physiology to know if this is even possible, but it’s an example of what we are talking about: a fast twitch guy who used to be in an explosive power event who does longer stuff in his 30’s.",

It is all relative, someone can be FT, but not have the biomechanics, body shape, or strength to be elite. Similarly, someone can be extremely ST, but because of poor biomechanics, can be beaten in a long distance race by someone more FT. However, the two types of physiology generally generate higher/lower lactate levels, clear lactate slower/faster, and recover differently. My understanding is that these differences can’t be trained away. Threshold training, which is what this thread is about, is one area where the training may have to be more suited to the runner, rather than generic.

I had suspicion I was quite aerobically deficient as the 9:00 easy runs I was doing kind of trashed me over time and I could never have consistency in volume across weeks. this week I got a lactate test and discovered I am quite aerobically deficient and my LT1 pace is 10:32 and LT2 is 8:02. Pretty crazy someone who raced 3 miles recently at 6:18 pace has a LT 2 mins slower about. I am sharing this because had I listened to the calculators and race conversion equations, I would wind up absolutely trashing myself in workouts running them way over my LT2. If this system is something you all would like to try, I would highly recommend either lactate testing or doing the HR drift test to approximate LT2 and the friel 30 min test to approximate LT2.",

    "message": "Coincidentally, some of us from the thread were recently discussing the topic of lactate testing and lab protocol (during a secret meeting to plan sirpoc’s clandestine speed workouts for January). The revelation of SDHJ’s lactate test and thoughtfully shared point regarding personalization, made me think of the Hadd thread and how his core principles parallel this thread. Particularly, how one’s general aerobic conditioning is often the biggest limiter. For those interested, I’ll link a summary document that was put together years ago by a follower of that thread. Hadd’s 5*2400m HR Test protocol is the main aspect which I thought may be helpful to those without a lactate meter and/or those who feel they may be “underdeveloped” aerobically. Without going into all the detail (it’s included in the document), the general test protocol is the following: 2400m at 70% HRMax with 90 seconds recovery 2400m at 75% HRMax with 90 seconds recovery 2400m at 80% HRMax with 90 seconds recovery 2400m at 85% HRMax with 90 seconds recovery 2400m at 90% HRMax with 90 seconds recovery You could use the first 800m to lock into the effort/pace then take the time and average HR value for each 1600m as the representative value for that repeat. The objective being that you want to see a “tight” relationship across the entire spectrum of paces, thus indicating you have a strong aerobic engine. A good relationship would be approximately 4-5 seconds per 400m difference as you move through those HR percentages. So, for example: 1:46 per 400m @ 70% HRMax 1:42 per 400m @ 75% HRMax 1:38 per 400m @ 80% HRMax 1:34 per 400m @ 85% HRMax 1:30 per 400m @ 90% HRMax There are obviously many test protocols one could create, as have been shared already on the thread. The main motivation for sharing this one though is the feedback it provides across a spectrum of paces, as opposed to one specific pace. Hope everyone is enjoying their holiday and best of luck in your 2024 training and racing!",

    "message": "Haha… it was indeed just a humorous remark in reference to those who think sirpoc is doing some type of hidden speed work. Something I should add to my post is how Hadd utilized a 10 mile (~60 minute) tempo with the intent of seeing the pace and HR for the tempo align with that achieved on the 2400m interval at ~85% HRMax. That would be the signal that you’ve reached your target from the perspective of fully establishing an aerobic base. Also, to clarify, I don’t think you have to follow Hadd’s approach regarding workouts (he primarily utilized straight tempos, as opposed to intervals ) but the general principle of “pushing” the threshold down as opposed to “pulling” it down, paired with the emphasis on being patient and consistent and not forcing the training, I think, is the emphasis of a threshold based training system. Using his test protocol is primarily a way to get a concrete estimate of the pace and HR (if using that) to stay between. Meaning, where your fitness is actually at as opposed to where it should theoretically be, as was the case with SDHJ’s recent experience. P.S. If you do read the document, it talks in detail about all of this. Also, the athlete Hadd highlighted to convey his approach returned to training after a long layoff later in life and, like sirpoc, ran near exclusively tempo efforts, yet continued to improve his race times. Hmm… must have been those secret speed sessions haha",

Same for KI, admittedly until recently he hasn't done anything faster than around 10-12k pace. sirpoc has mentioned I believe in this very thread, there is a point even with this that you cannot and won't improve anymore without changing something up. Considering Kristoffer has been going a bit longer than sirpoc, he probably hit that point first. I did, notice, Kristoffer has been doing reps, paces, sessions that sirpoc has was doing first, so maybe they are communicating and learning from each other, which I would find pretty cool.

    "message": "I fear I may have discovered this thread too late! I too have been training with a modified version of Norwegian training. Not quite the same as Sirpoc’s, but similar enough. I too have been running PRs at an age where I would not have expected that such things would be possible (age 46). I’m not as fast in the 5k as I was many moons ago as a DIII college runner, but I’m close. And for distances over 8k, I’m better than I ever was. Some comments and thoughts that perhaps add something to this very long thread. -As background, I live at nearly 8000 ft. of elevation. I was more of a speed guy back in the day (4:07-1500) who was relatively weak in longer distances (16:07 5k, 27:28 8k) (dare I say, \"fast twitch\"). I can still run a 27-second 200 at 46. I used to be able to run a 52-second split on a 4x4. -My marathon PR is 2:59, which I ran while training for the Leadville 100 (which I finished in 23 hours) with just jogging the mountains as training. I suspect I can knock 10 minutes off that if I dedicate myself to it, but just haven’t had time or motivation to do so. I just ran my first sub hour 10 mile three days ago. I ran my first sub 36 10k four days before that. I’m at low elevations while visiting the inlaws, so clustering in some time trials. Never did an interval longer than 6:15 in training. My quads are thrashed from back-to-back long time trials, so not sure I’d recommend that! -I train with a HRM and test lactate after most of my workouts. -I typically do 2-3 threshold sessions a week. I sometimes do a Bakken-style “x” element workout when I’m training for something shorter than 5k. I aim for 20-25% of my volume in thresholds. I do my easy days sub 70% of max HR, which ain’t easy at 8000 feet when nothing is flat. Plenty of hills in my neighborhood force my pace to slower than 10’ a mile. Sometimes I’m sub-7 sub 120 HR on the downs. -I occasionally do a 20 x 300 off 1’ (jogging the remaining 100 of the 400) at 5k pace. As long as I stick to current (not goal) 5k pace, I find that my lactate stays below 3.5 mmol/l on those sessions. If I do these in 62.x, I’ll be around 3 mmol/l. That’s low 17s for 5k at 7000’. For folks that want to pursue this training, this is similar to the 20 x 400 session that the Ingebrigtens (occasionally) do (Bakken wrote about it in the article published previously on this thread), except it takes me the same amount of time to do a 300 as it takes them to do a 400! -I find that 20 x 200 at current mile pace (not goal mile pace) with a 200 super easy jog ends with my lactate around 3.5. Just putting that out there. -I have not found the heart rate correlation to be quite as linear as others. Sometimes I can get my HR up to 170 and keep my lactate below 3.0. Other times that sends me up above threshold. I find, with a few exceptions, if I stay below 168, I’m safely below 3.5, but at the threshold, the results vary wildly (I appreciate that last sentence might seem inconsistent with the ethos of this thread, but I play around with things for the sake of experimentation). -For some reason, my lactate tends to go above 3.0 at 168 at low altitude and closer to 170 at 7000 and 8000 ft. No clue why. -On a couple of occasions, I found out I was about to get sick through my lactate meter. On sessions when I felt fine and I kept my HR below the typical thresholds, my lactate was through the roof, totally unexpectedly (8-plus). One time I got bronchitis the next day. The other, a 24-hour flu. -I find that a bad night’s sleep can also send the lactate through the roof. I check my body battery whenever I’m doing a thresh sesh and make sure it’s not atypically low. If it is, I drop the volume by 20% and HR by 5 beats a minute, and that usually works out ok for me. For me, the lactate meter is much more sensitive to life stress than HRM. -I’m also a volunteer track coach, and I apply a version of these principals to the athletes I coach. Mostly high school kids, but I coach a couple of national-class masters athletes as well. -I keep the X element for kids I coach, because three sessions of threshold is hard for most of them mentally, and I think it matters for distances under 5k. -This training is not effective for the 800, in case anyone might have any illusions about that. It’s fine for athletes that are new to the sport that just need to strength to run two good laps, but for boys near 2 and girls near 2:20, this methodology is not effective by itself, though sometimes I do half a threshold session with some added intensity at the end, and that has been fairly effective as a hybrid workout. -For anyone training for the mile to the half marathon, I think this training is markedly superior to Daniels-style training, or Vo2 max training. After I ran ultras, I spent my late 30s doing countless iterations of intense-style training. Kept getting injured and barely got better. -I’m on a 320-day running streak now. Most days I run at least an hour a day. Never felt better.",

Enter this value as LTHR in your Garmin. - Total the recovery time suggested by Garmin for each workout of the week as total recovery time per week in h. - Do 2 or 3 sub-threshold workouts per week, 3 or 4 easy runs. Easy runs of 55-65 min each. One easy run longer. Dial the pace of your easy runs AND the volume of the sub-threshold work to yield a total recovery time per week of 168 h. - As you get fitter, you can increase your pace of the easy runs and/or the volume of sub-threshold runs. But stick to the 168h and aim for as much fast volume as possible (however not exceeding 25% of total mileage) with easy runs @70% HRmax. Have fun!",

Does anyone feel like they’ve successfully applied this type of training to marathon training, and if so, how? My current thought is that if I were to do this, I would do two thresholds and a long run tempo most weeks. Or maybe my alternate training as espoused by this thread with that schedule every other week. Almost every top-notch marathoner I’ve ever read about, including Shorter, Rodgers, Kipchoge, Kiptum, etc.—all do/did longer, continuous tempo efforts. Bakken says long continuous efforts are needed for good marathons. I was thinking about dialing in 2-hour to runs to finish with lactate at 2.5 mmol. Though I have no idea how I would do that at this stage or what paces would get me there. I think Sirpoc has argued in favor three thresholds and an easy two-hour run for marathon training. Does anyone have any evidence, however anecdotal, that the latter approach would be superior to the former? I know that Hard2Find laid out his approach earlier, so I’ve seen that. My hypothesis is that some sustained quality efforts are needed to run a marathon to one’s full potential. But I’m no expert, and I’m open to contrary evidence, if people think it’s out there. And since I have felt good and had no injuries with this approach, I'd rather not deviate too far from it. Thanks.",

I think it was Unbelief who jumped on me before for suggesting LT1 is approximately 150 minute race pace. Well, better trained runners are indeed producing such little lactate at that pace the difference between LT1 (~150 minute race pace) and LT2 (~60 minute race pace) is minimal. Thus, squeezing their LT1 down very close to their LT2. Canova would put it as, you don't want to be in peak 10km shape if you're planning to run your best marathon because you'd be producing too much lactate at marathon pace to be metabolically optimized. As far as implementing training in a way you're describing, the following may be of interest. It's general template Ryan Hall and Meb Keflezighi used when they were with the Mammoth group: Long Run w/ Fartlek Easy + Hill Sprints Long Intervals Easy Short Tempo Run + Short Intervals Easy Long w/ Tempo Easy Easy + Hill Sprints Long Intervals Medium Long Run Easy Long Tempo Run Easy",

I think I already have a pretty narrow gap between those two thresholds, or at least it’s narrow enough to achieve my modest goals.

What I’m hoping to find is a methodology that lets me keep the bones of the Norwegian method with just enough adjustments to succeed at the longer distance by preparing myself for the muscle fatigue that comes with that distance. Is one two hour run every other week sufficient? Is a long slow effort sufficient? My instinct is to stick with a Pfitzinger intensity long run with some frequency, but the question is how frequently do I need to do that to achieve the modest goal of a 2:49?",

The Norwegian method is 98% aerobic. Closer to 100% for folks like Sirpoc. Thresholds weekly though March are still great for 800 runners, but the mix of work has to reflect the demands of the race. And that’s not exclusively aerobic training if you’re an 800 runner. You need serious speed and intensity, without neglecting the aerobic system. Race early and often if you’re an 800 runner!

But yes, using your generalization and the one that is common in referencing the two, LT1 would be identified as 2.0 mmol and LT2 identified as 4.0 mmol. If you’re testing yourself, which I believe you said you do, you could perform your own lactate step test and approximate both LT1 and LT2. Some would say that LT1 is an actual metabolic threshold, whereas LT2 is arbitrary. Lexel would probably make this point, since there is an actual “bioenergetic shift” occurring at LT1. LT2 generally leaves room to speed up a bit more (to CS) before a “steady state” is no longer achievable, no matter how small a step increase nor short a duration used, in a test. At least, typically according to lab data from physiologists who test these demarcations.",

I don’t mean the at all in a sarcastic way, btw. There are certainly no absolutes of what you MUST do for your training. You could certainly just stick to easy/moderate paced long runs, every other week and be fine. You could also implement long runs with tempo pace mixed in. You could do 1-2 long tempos in the 12-15 mile range in addition to your normal easy long runs. The choice is really yours and what you want to put into it. If sub 2:50 is the goal, depending on how fast you are at the shorter distances (I’d use a 10km as the basis), will influence how close to your “marathon potential” you have to be in order to achieve it. Meaning, if you can run sub 36 10km, you don’t need to be as nearly “marathon fit” as if you run 36:40 for 10km, to break 2:50. I’d be curious to hear what it is you want to do for marathon training versus what it is you feel you have to do to conform to the Norwegian method?

It would be very rare to have any observation below 1.0 or above 3.0 mmol once the athletes figured out their levels.

There would be many observations above 5, and some likely above 7 and 8, sometimes even above 10, because when the onset of rapid blood lactate accumulate occurs, it comes on fast. And if you're riding THAT line, it's very easy to go over. That's why the Norwegian method stresses staying 5% under that line. All that's to say that I'm obviously not familiar with all the literature here, but something very different is occurring in terms of lactate accumulation around 4.0 mmol than at 2.0 mmol.

Critical Speed is considered the maximal metabolic steady state. So while blood lactate can rise higher than MLSS, your oxygen consumption will stabilize along with some other bio-markers like phosphocreatine (facilitates muscle contraction) and inorganic phosphate (identifies muscle fatigue). This stabilization won't happen at a speed faster than CS. This suggests that you can run at a faster speed than MLSS before you reach a “true” metabolic steady state. The difference in pace can be relatively marginal and I don’t think the training paces that are then implemented yield any noticeable difference in performance, but that’s the general distinction though. BTW, I’m certainly not suggesting to lump LT1 and LT2 together as essentially the same. They are indeed distinct… even if no one can agree on how to officially define them haha",

    "message": "Been following this thread. I did something simple - I started with Jakob's 'old' training : Easy 10k twice daily Subthreshold 5 x 2k (same as 6 mins for Jakob) twice daily Easy 10k twice daily Sub threshold 10 x 1k twice daily Easy 10k twice daily Sub threshold 25 x 400m twice daily And for hobbyjoggers we agreed on one session a day. I have been running 50 years now so I just basically chopped everything in half - instead of 2k/1k/400m I do 1k/500m/200m. I used the tinman calculator to choose the slowest thresh times for my current fitness and I dont think for someone like me the easy days have to be running days - so I just walk. I also have a unique situation that there is no flat ground near my house - I live in a bowl and everywhere is up to start. And finally most of the year like now with the snow - there is only ONE road I can train on So I just came up with the same 10k workout for EVERY SubThresh day : 10 x 200m 5 pct grade up 12 x 500m 2 pct grade up and down 2x1k 5 pct grade back down 60 secs of rest between each run Doing the short little hops (200m) on the way up in the beginning and saving the long runs (1k) for the way back down works great. I also dont do long runs since my main focus is 800m and injury prevention. And since EVERY day is a hill day I dont need to do any xtra sessions of those either. For the uphills I add a few seconds to the tinman times and for the downhills I subtract a few seconds - usually about 5 seconds per 200m seems to work good for the grades I am on. And finally I am retired and try to exercise outdoors every day so a 6 day schedule works a lot better for me. I used to take days off but I found that they just made me feel worse so I go every day now unless I get hurt or is some kind of emergency. So its basically : Day 1 : Walk an hour or so (about 7k) Day 2 : Thresh session : 600m warmup / 10x200m / 12x500m / 2x1k / 600m cooldown wash rinse repeat every 2 days To ease into this I am starting with 4x500m (instead of 12x500m) for a total of 6k a session and plan on adding a couple of 500m runs each month until I hit the same 10k total as the Ingebrigtsens about 4 or 5 months from now - at the same time dropping my thresh times as my fitness levels improve. Its working quite well. The biggest problem I have is forcing myself to run that slow - taking a while to get myself to SLOW DOWN. And second thing that has really shocked and pleased me is how much easier this feels than running this entire road in one stretch with no breaks - which is pretty much what my 'training' has been for years now. Running SubThresh with the 60 seconds rests basically takes almost all the pain out of running. Those 60 sec rests are like respawning in a video game to me and I feel really good at night after any of those thresh sessions are done. And yes its boring but I dont mind that - I think all the Ingebrigtsen training is going to be boring no matter what u do - and in any case every day here is different - on that road last summer I ran into 2 bears and a cougar in just 6 weeks. So that keeps me awake LOL I turn 65 a year from now and my goal is to be in the top 10 USA for 800m. I havent done a race in decades but I did an 800m time trial with my 17 year old son on the track and that time put me at 50th for age group 60-64 so I think this new training could get me there if I can stick it out for the next year or so.",

    "message": "I'll add my thoughts, for what weight it carries. I went from 39:31 to 36:33 from reading this thread back last summer when it really exploded. I was stuck around 39 for a long, long time. Maybe around 4-5 years. That was variation between different plans, coaches etc. In fact I probably have spent more on coaching and books than everyone in this thread combined! Not that I mind , I love my hobby. I started off almost in real time of page 1 of this thread. I read a lot of LRC and thought why not, I seem to run around 39-40 no matter what. I just love 10ks. No idea why. Sucker for pain maybe. They hurt. Anyway, I have stuck pretty much to sirpoc rules. No lactate meter. Just the paces. The only thing I have changed is when Hard2find came along I switched to his document he provided with those paces. It sounded like himself, sirpoc and a few others perhaps worked on this anyway, from reading between the lines and posts here. Yes I have read everything! Not a lot happened. For at least 5-6 weeks. Then suddenly I noticed the 3x3ks I had been doing, suddenly got quite a bit faster. Then the same just kept happening, every second or third week. That was about it was as simple as that. Now I was very curious about as to how this on earth was possible. I am pretty much doing the same amount of hours , 6-7, as I was before. Here is where reading the thread helped. A lot. Well reading it a second time. I plugged all my data into the recommended intervals icu from the past to check past training loads. My CTL or fitness, and this is why you should read the thread, has increased and kept increasing in this time. The overall load of training this way with regards to the way previous coaches had me running, by the metrics, is quite a bit more. This is covered quite a bit somewhere in the middle pages. This is why I think a podcast that has been mentioned would be a great idea, to really summarise it. Anyway, there seems to be a clear relation between increasing of load and then overall performance. I think it's as simple as that. The key is you are doing more, probably aerobically, but the way it is managed, is less taxing on the body. So you are effectively increasing your services capacity, which, at hobby jogger level for the majority of people will lead to better performance. The crazy thing is it feels like you are doing less. I will say, I follow sirpoc on Strava like others. This dude is a machine. The will power he must have to run the same stuff, day in, day out is remarkable. Seeing it myself is really all that keeps me going, as I can see you will improve. But it really, really is not fun. But the feeling I got from such a huge PB made it all worthwhile. I would rather have that in my pocket than feel like a workout hero like before, then be disappointing on race day. Anyway, I hope maybe that provides some insight. I am no expert! But I am a massive fan of the thread and absolutely thrilled I found it and it has totally, totally changed the way I think about running . It has been hard to adjust. I didn't even own a smart watch until 2 years ago, so I am very much of the old skool!!",

I ran in the mid-3:50s and low 15 minute range for 1500/5000 using the easy interval method a couple of years ago, but after that initial success I started to stagnate pretty badly and haven't improved on those times at all in the last two years despite training just as hard and switching back to a more traditional approach for the last 6-8 months or so. I just can't seem to get past that plateau. Others in this thread have compared this approach to the EIM but I feel where the EIM falls short is in the lack of recovery days. Doing 6x1k, 10x400, etc day after day, week after week, wears you down but also in my view does not provide an adequate stimulus due to the long recoveries between intervals. This approach, in contrast, provides more stimulus per workout while still being repeatable AND providing adequate recovery. I'm in my 30s and self-coached so I don't really have anything to lose by giving this a shot. Since I am familiar with the concept through EIM of running intervals slower than what you could handle on the day I think the transition should be pretty seamless. On paces, I will err on the easier/slower side to start as I do come from a middle distance background and in the one half marathon I attempted over the last couple years I blew up horribly at 8 miles and DNFed so I suspect my threshold is pretty weak compared to what you'd expect from my middle distance times. If I feel this approach is worthwhile, I may spring for a lactate meter at some point but to start given my middle distance background I will use the paces that sirpoc provided but will use the predicted pace for the distance one higher (i.e., for \"HM pace\", I will use \"M pace\", for \"CV\" I will use \"HM\", and so on) until I feel I've adapted to the program.",

I have done EIM, but like you say there's not enough in the sessions in terms of overall load. I've learned about CTL from this thread. I personally, think it is a bit vague, but I will say with this method which is repeatable, you can definitely very clearly see a link between increasing your load and getting faster. With the EIM I simply think there wasn't enough in the actual sessions and probably too many of them spread out. I think the 3rd session a week personally is the difference maker in terms of load but also creating a huge aerobic engine in the 3x a week sub threshold appraoch. You only have to see sirpoc results in this thread. He is on the absolute shortest side you can get of a long run but is still in absolute control right up to HM. That is the biggest thing I have taken away from this I guess a long with absolutely no longer worrying about speed work. All the speed sessions in the world won't make you faster if you don't have that aerobic engine. That comes with pushing your threshold up from below. I would highly recommend you join the Strava group. Follow KI but also sirpoc84. He is very good as responding on there as this thread calms down a bit. There's good activity in the group. But I think this thread will live on, as truly I believe it's the best thread for a hobby jogger in LRC history.",

I.e. right now I am in 21:xx 5k shape and will do the thresholds based on that CURRENT pace. Then after 8-12 weeks of doing 5x2000, 3x3000, 10x10000 w/EZ runs on other days, re-test 5k and get 20:xx. Then use the thresholds at the 20:xx equivalent on the TMN or JD calculator and do the same thing for another 8-12 weeks?",

He said with regards to this, that usually he just waits for a race result to shift his paces , but if he goes a while and feels like he is faster he will shift based on a session like 3*3200 becoming faster for the same RPE or HR per lap. When he's done this, the race result shortly after would usually confirm this anyway. But that the beauty of this system over since he has done this for well over year now is that you become familiar with the performance patterns. I hope that sort of answers your question as I was very curious about this exact thing myself.",

But the interesting thing was my CTL was at its highest after all this 2.5+ hour riding on the turbo, every single day and then I hit a power pb. IMO as long as data collection is good, I see a clear relationship in cycling power and overall load. Now, in running, I see some (but not all) of the same relationship. That, in general, for someone time crunched, CTL is a reasonably good indicator of that more is going to equal a faster time. There's more factors that go into running, including not having a yardstick to measure against like we do with power in cycling and also the data collection is probably less accurate. As I have said before, the way I'm training I don't actually think is the best way. But, I do believe it's the best way on the limited hours and time I have? Could I reach X training load on the hours I have got any other way? Probably not. Would I train this way if I had 12+ hours a week? Probably not, also. Definitely would incorporate doubles, more % of easy running and potentially an x factor session. I'm close to the limit now, FWIW I believe on that my CTL is flattening out and I will find it hard to get much faster, without doing something different ( by which I mean more hours).

He’s also injured at the moment (I think he mentioned in the recent article having little injuries since 2019?) You really don’t need a high dose of speed to get the benefits. Even something like 10 x 30s hills would be a good starting point when it is a new stimulus, especially if you really push the hills hard.

If solo, I’ve done a consistent but not taxing pace (7:15-7:40) for the first part of the run before a 4-5 mile continuous, progressively faster segment at faster than MP (6:20-6:40). The pace is below HMP or what I would do in a long threshold. Cooldown of 1-3 miles done at moderate pace. Running with a group, often less flexibility but I’d prefer to run a slightly faster tempo overall 7:10-7:25) with a faster finish than start if possible (6:45-7:05). I think these runs end up being a little different and more specific to the marathon than the Norwegian method of course. From my experience, outside of getting the valuable time on feet and practice for fueling/marathon distance etc., they build a nice comfort running at MP (for raceday) though rarely dialing into the exact effort/pace. Id say my training might be best suited for 5K-HM but my last marathon I felt extremely comfortable in despite bad conditions. I am not all-in on a time in my marathon running really though maybe that changes for Boston. And getting ready for the mile only requires a few specific workouts (hills/speed), and honestly some prep races can do the trick as well. Nordas has said that and I agree. So to the poster directly above I’d say hills (I do 12x200 w/ jog down rest), a speed workout or two (4-3-2 sets, good rest) and some prep races. For the mile/3k I think you’d be all set. I ran under 4:50 at 5th Ave on a short buildup with that. We’ll see if with a real summer I can go sub-4;40 and perhaps sub-17. The 800 is a different matter for me requiring a little more specificity.",

    "message": "I think one of the reasons this has been such an insightful discussion for many is that this method produces fantastic results in a commonsense way, YET flies in the face of foundational training philosophies. There have been several in disbelief of the results achieved. I think behind their troll appearance may be genuine questions of WHY this works. Like Summary shared, here was a great post around page 60 summarizing what this training methodology IS, and I think it would also be fruitful to summarize what this is NOT and WHY. Below are common training ideas that are challenged in this approach. Note that these comments are for 5k-HM not the Marathon, which is a different beast. Periodization: No up weeks or down weeks. No weeks with shifting focus. No peaking. Just settle into your maximum sustainable training load and repeat. This not only works for hobby joggers from this thread, but also for the elites coach by Grete Koens. Perhaps periodization is an engineered way to handle a training system that inherently tears you down more than it builds you up? Progressive Overload: The workouts do not need to progress for you to progress. There will be a ceiling to this approach, but it will take a surprisingly long time and will take you much higher than other approaches. There is a progression, but it looks more like season over season rather than week over week. Variety: Variety is overrated (and helps coaches keep their jobs). Running is simple. A 5k is 95-99% an aerobic event. Variety works in fields like investing because there is no way to know for certain what will pay off. But in running, we know what trains the aerobic system with little cost: easy running and sub threshold running. In this case, the best investment strategy is going all in what we know works FOR THE LEAST COST. Specificity: This is a big one. Perhaps a good way of looking at this methodology is that the quality of a session is determined by how little recovery time it costs you, rather than how strong the stimulus is in preparing you for the event. Adaptations take a long time, so any stimulus will need to be highly repeatable for it to have any effect. To stimulate the demands of an event there will need to be ample recover, resulting in lower overall training load due to needed recovery time. Better to keep aerobic load high and humming along, and just freshen up as needed before events. Grete Koens does this approach for her elites as well. She says that the 1 specific session before a major event are more to convince the athlete they can perform, rather than any underlying physiology. Training at 5k pace consistently WILL make you more efficient at 5k pace—however, it will cost you. And it’s the cost that matters in the long term (injury/ overall training load). Also, racing fairly frequently helps with performance. Often, a 5k race is less taxing than a 5k specific session! Speed Training: I love strides. I’m surprised that KI and Spiroc don’t do them. But it makes sense, because the likelihood that speed is the limiting factor for hobbyjoggers like me is very low. We are all aerobically undertrained, and no amount of short speed will make up for that. I hope this helps summarize what this training is NOT. I'd love to hear y'alls thoughts!",

Remember , 3 sub threshold workouts seems to be the key to this system in accumulation of as much weekly tss as we can. As sirpoc posted a few pages back, there isn't anything inherently special about what he set out, it will just likely be the best makeup for someone time crunched and looking to maximise load but still recover suitable to just keep repeating. This is incredibly simple yet actually quite complicated all at the same time. So I will throw my weight behind it would be good to get sirpoc on a podcast for someone to ask the right questions and really drill down and lay this out from start to finish.",

As I said above, the thing I think overlooked is as sirpoc said when he popped up in the thread again lately, there's nothing actually special about this, other than he's thinking of it outside the box more like a cyclist and just applying it to another aerobic sport. I found it incredibly interesting of how he found CTL marry up closer to power, no matter what the training makeup. The variation in that seems to exist, but likely small. It would be great if anyone could answer as to why sirpoc and KI don't do strides, other than the answer of \"they just don't do strides\" . Again, this is a huge deviation away from the norm. But, following the two on Strava , they don't ever run very fast in training really and then it has no negative effect on race day. In fact sirpoc has probably the best equivalent times from 5k , 10k, 10 mile and HM all within a couple of months. They are all almost all within a few seconds of each other. Which also shows fantastic pacing if you look at his race splits but also that specificity itself appears to be irrelevant, for a hobby jogger just looking to improve overall in the grand scheme of things. It doesn't appear sirpoc in particular is slowing down anytime soon, he will soon surely break 16 Anyway, I enjoyed the post although now I think I have moved quite away from your interesting points.",

But when done correctly they are very in line with this underlying philosophy: get the training adaptations at the least cost. I really enjoyed this blog post from a while back showing how strides transformed a very aerobically trained trail runner. Perhaps one of the reasons strides worked for Andrew Skurka, and may not be needed for Spiroc and KI, is the terrain they train in? Skurka coming from a train background was not efficient for fast road running. But KI and Spiroc's training is pretty much all on roads or treadmill (not Spiroc lol), meaning they are may be getting enough practice on flat/fast terrain? Also, we know that there are diminishing returns with everything, so strides are likely more important the shorter the race...But again, there are many coach who feel strongly that top end speed is important even for marathon/ ultras!",

I get it, I’m shocked as well that folks can get such great results off of just a 75 min long run. You said that his HM is not as good as his 5k….barely. Looking at how tightly coupled spiroc’s 5k, 10k, 10mile and HM times are is just astounding. Like thread voyager said earlier, it’s as if specificity (long run in this case for the HM) is irrelevant if you have a great base. Some who follow this method like to put their Sub T into a long run to get better specificity for the HM. But the point is that no one session matters that much, it’s about maximizing total training quality/volume. So the question isn’t should I do a longer long run, it’s how much is that going to cost me and the overall approach? People respond to training differently. Maybe you can do a more taxing long run and bounce back for 3 sub Ts after (doubt it). This training methodology isn’t saying that any type of training is bad. It’s not saying that a long run isn’t valuable. It’s just saying that long term load is the greatest predictor of performance (which some disagree with, that’s fine.) So if you accept that CTL is the main driver, no single session is that important, including the long run. You have a training budget. With a budget, you can’t have it all. That’s why I think it’s important to articulate what this training is NOT, so going in, you know and accept the trade offs. And maybe those trade offs aren’t for you, but I’m going to give it a try :)",

    "message": "I just thought I would post up whilst I have a chance today, as there has been a bit of renewed talk here this week and a few questions that have come up. Firstly, would I be quicker if I did X instead of Y? That's difficult to answer, but again I feel that this comes back to to specificity is a very small factor in the bigger picture. If anyone is in the Strava group, Hard2Find has made an absolutely amazing spreadsheet where you can run models and prepare different training weeks and calculate what load it will bring. He is way smarter than me, myself him, jiggy and shirtboy started discussing something like this only a few days ago and its already made and into version 3 or 4. This won't necessarily answer what makes someone quicker, but is probably the best and most powerful planning tool I've seen made specifically for runners, maybe ever. Which brings be onto a second point, about how I don't specifically feel sub threshold is anything magical, just how my experience from cycling shows it gives the best bang for your buck when it comes to CTL. Now, I have been speaking to a number of old friends who I used to communicate training ideas and sharing of data with when cycling recently, talking to them about training makeup and how it matches or indexes to overall CTL and performance. The difference seemed to range from virtually no difference for me (in terms of getting to a certain CTL was all that mattered, no matter how), to most other people over years of data, seeing difference in training makeup to get to a certain CTL and what power output that resulted in. So the spread in all of our data, was from about 0% difference right up to 11%. One of the guys had a lot of data on swimmers he coached and found the same sort of thing. His suggested was that a reasonable training plan (he mentioned a Maglischo as a baseline) would probably sway around 5% up and down based on the worst conceivable way to train you could think of (totally unstructured) to the best bang for your buck on around 5-10 hours, which appeared in most cases to be sub threshold. In case anyone is unclear on what I am saying here, the example might here my FTP might be 300w on a pretty normal looking textbook training schedule, for a CTL of lets say 80. A totally unstructured and just riding/running randomly makeup, might mean I need a bit more CTL, lets say 85, to reach 300w. But it might only take a CTL of maybe a bit less than 80, to reach 300w when doing sub threshold work. Now, one thing it also does appear, as the hours increase and you are less time crunched, the gap looks to probably close a bit and the options you also have of makeup of training, shrinks as well as you will be doing 80%+ or more very easy work, whereas I am sticking by to 75-25%. Why is this the case? who knows, probably all TSS isn't created equal, maybe a traditional training program for any of the aerobic sports has more vo2 work than you need and it tires you out for everything else. Maybe there is another reason. So the big question is, how does looking at top amateur riders and a bunch of swimmers (which I must stress, is not pulled from scientific studies) transfer to running? Well as I have said before, I have seen the same play out in my own running training. Will it be the same for everyone? probably not, but if we had another data long term, I am sure we would see the patterns there. One of the main problems is runners don't seem to collect data about their own training accurately, which is the main issue. Even if they have years worth of data, they aren't updating thresholds, zones (sorry Coggan, I mean levels) so their actual daily TSS and overall CTL lacks accuracy. Could you probably ice the cake better if you want to train for a specific event? Probably. If you absolutely only were going to do 5ks, should you try and find a balance of some sort of 5k pace or vo2 max work? Probably. Is it going to be the limiting factor for a hobby jogger? Probably not. The other good thing about training like this is you can pretty much be in peak shape for a range of events , 5k to HM I am within a few seconds of where I want to be. Right, that's long enough on that, but it's something quite a few people have asked me about lately so thought I would spend some time going through some of where I am at on it. A couple of other of small notes. I've come to the conclusion this is about 5-8.5 hours max here as the sweetspot, to running this sweetspot stuff, excuse the pun, on this singles approach. You could maybe do a touch less, but having thought about it more I don't think you will be getting the benefit . The third session is the key to creating that extra bit of load, week in, week out that all adds up in the end. Anything much less than 5 hours, realistically you are losing the benefit as it just doesn't give you enough hours for 3 sessions and to keep things fresh and sustainable. Two other updates. No I don't run 400s anymore. They didn't create anymore or less lactate and they trash my legs for the next day more (I've dumped them for a while and still improving at the same linear rate in the 5k) and I've upped the rest to 2 mins on the 3200 because in the week in the route I run after work, there's a road I need to cross and it takes more than the 1 minute rest to get over it ha ha so literally no special reason. Same with doing 1600s not 2ks. No actual reason other than that I don't have to cross a road mid run. A bit random, but I saw these questions somewhere in the thread a while back and forgot to answer them! P.S I'm not sure who made me guardian of the thread. There's other guys way smarter than me here. My only skill I think is learning quite quickly what works and what doesn't when it comes to training. If this has all helped anyone over the last 7-8 months, that's awesome. I'm under no illusions myself that I am as good as running as I was cycling, but I am still enjoying it and still improving. I turn 40 next month, fingers crossed I can make it to Sub 16 before then.",

In the sense, if you look at their power curves, their peak 5s power was well north of 1200w . Whereas my peak 5s power ever is like 730w or something. Someone smarter than me might be able to explain why this is. It might not mean anything. It might be an anomaly. It might not apply to running.

    "message": "I have been consistently following this method for the past 3 months. I had no races during that period, but 3 months ago I ran 2 half marathons, finishing in 1:22 and 1:23. My personal record (PR) was set 2 years ago at 1:19. After that, I focused on running 2 marathons and encountered a few injuries. Consequently, my speed in the half marathon distance dropped a bit, and I was struggling to return to a sub-1:20 half. I slowly started implementing this training method since about September. I did lactate testing and was surprised right away by how much faster lactate accumulates than I thought, which required me to adjust my paces accordingly. Most of my training was done on a treadmill since the weather has been poor here in the winter, and I work from 8 am to 5 pm, leaving no time for outdoor training during daylight hours. I began with 10x3-minute intervals at about 15.5 km/h, 6x5-minute intervals at 15 km/h and 10x3-minute intervals at 14.5 km/h. I successfully completed every workout and gradually increased my pace by 0.1 km/h each week. Currently, I am running at 16.4, 15.9, and 15.4 km/h. Every third week, I reduced the volume to about 70-80%, akin to a recovery week. Long run 60-90min. Now, my normal weeks consist of approximately 85 km of running, with easier weeks around 60 km. Additionally, I incorporate Zwift bike rides—easy lower zone 2 training—about 3-6 times a week, lasting 40-60 minutes, as I recover without any issues in time. On easy days when I feel fresh, I also added 6 short strides on the treadmill, lasting about 15-30 seconds, to work on a bit of top-end speed at 18 km/h with a 9% incline. I've been using a Sole treadmill for workouts, and it seems to me that all the paces I've been running are significantly faster. For instance, the 10-minute intervals I run on the treadmill at 15.4 km/h translate to easily running sub-3:40 per km outside. On my recovery days, I run at about 130 bpm. In November, that pace was about 5:05 to 5:15 per km, and now it's about 4:30 per km. I've tried following many plans before with mixed results, and this approach is the easiest to follow, and I recover much faster than ever before and feel much stronger. Anyway, it seems to me like I could run a about 1:17 half marathon right now, and I have a race coming up this Sunday. I will report on the result.",

Now I go outside when the weather has been better lately to train, it seems to translate better to then when I race outside. Just a small observation, maybe all TSS indoors versus out isn't equal for the same workout? Does anyone know if this is why sirpoc runs always outside?

If we could establish a good amount of appropriately accurate collected runners data it would be interesting to see if there's that same link between CTL and performance. Maybe 5k time to line it up with would make sense? But the big one would be from what sirpoc posted, that I found incredibly interesting. Is the difference in performance in running also around 10% between the best and worst training you could possibly conceive, for the same training makeup. This is going to be very hard to answer, if you are smart enough to track CTL, you probably aren't dumb enough to do a really bad training block just for our own experiments. This I think would answer many of the big questions a lot of us have always wondered. Maybe having an outsider coming and looking in has helped. I myself have been locked into obsession over Daniels plans for far too long that I never even really considered there might be better way to train. It reminds me of when Tinman came along to the forum many years ago, I wish I probably had paid more attention then. Feels like this thread is the same breakout moment of a different way to look at training. Anyway thank you to all the guys here, especially Hard2find for all his amazing tools he seems to be able to create from nothing.

The people getting excited about this method are recreational athletes with: This methods makes very effective use of available training time, addressing the core limiting factor of performance for most recreational athletes (fundamental aerobic ability/steady state running/whatever you want to call it). It minimizes/eliminates the higher injury risk training types that aren't hugely relevant to most recreational athletes -things like high mechanical load of really fast running, high metabolic loads of really hard intervals, overexposure of fatigue from monster long runs. It's really simple and easy to follow, ensuring that the correct things get consistently done. A program from Daniels running formula (or similar books) tends to be prescriptive in a way that takes away common sense in the daily execution of training in my observations of athletes -so the practical reality of the training is often much worse than the hypothetical value of whats in the book.

That would seem rather logistically challenging but kind of hilarious in a way too if maybe we, say, added a tracking feature to it and could check in on where in the world is our VO2 Master at currently haha Not joking though about the idea of sorting something out where we establish a testing protocol and carry it out over the course of 18-24 weeks. Anything really that is simple and repeatable to 1) establish and consistently maintain an accurate FTP value and 2) for evaluating the correlation between CTL, training intensity distribution, and performance. Everyone could train to their preference, as long as they're logging their training accurately and performing the test with the agreed upon frequency. No forced regimens, if you miss a few days or weeks, CTL should capture that and reflect it in your next test. So, there's no pressure to be a workout warrior nor train flawlessly. The variation in approaches and abilities would actually be an asset in this case. Then, at the end of it, everyone can data dump on those of us with the skillset and desire to assemble, clean, analyze, and report on the groups undertaking. I said to sirpoc, jiggymeister, and shirtboy that I thought this would be more interesting and informative than any physiological journal publication I've read recently haha.

    "message": "Tuesday 10x3min (Or 7-8x on easy weeks), Thursday 5x6min(4x on easy weeks), Saturday 3x10min(or 2x 3km on easier weeks). Easy days are Monday, Wednesday and Friday, but each 2 weeks I skip the run on Monday to completely reset and feel fresh for next Threshold interval. On Wednesday and Friday I usually do strides at the end of the run 6 short ones 15-30sec. Sunday as a long run is 75-90min, running just a little faster than easy runs. I did about 200 lactate tests earlier this year, wasted first 50, just to get a feeling on how the lactate behaves. Most of the test were done on with the intervals I still do. But last 2 months I did not do any lactate testing. I don't think it is necessary at all to implement this method. Just be honest with your self and especially when starting, be safe with the pace to not get over the threshold. Like Marius Bakken wrote, if you go over the threshold by 10%(Probably LT2), you get 4-5x more fatigue than staying 10% under it. That's the whole point of this method. I think the paces I hold in intervals can be summed up as the 3min intervals at a bit faster than half marathon pace(around 5 sec per km), 6min intervals at half marathon pace and 10min intervals at pace a bit slower than half marathon pace(5-10sec). But you have to be honest with those paces, and not take the PR that was set on optimal conditions 2 years ago. If you don't feel fresh and struggle to hit all workouts, you are going 2 fast. If someone is doing about 60-80km of training, I am pretty sure they can pretty much jump right in and try this. Maybe start a bit safer by cutting a few intervals on first few weeks. I was injured around hip area for 1 year, so my stride was compromised a bit over the past year. I think my running technique was pretty bad and I was not utilizing muscles in top parts of the leg at all. I think I fixed that by adding in Zwift rides, about 3-5 hours total every week. I think a bit of cross training has huge benefit and can increase load which would injure you if it was done with pure running. Right now I am tapering for the race on Sunday",

But the most important aspect, is that while not being competitive myself anymore, I coach athletes who are, or who are trying to be. And since I started implementing ideas from this method, I have observed two things in my runners: 1. Zero injuries. 2. Continuous progress, improved times and results against long-time opponents. You talk about not wanting to \"expend a lot of mental bandwidth on complicated training schemes\". I have expended a lot of mental bandwidth over the years on complicated training schemes.

    "message": "Olbrecht is one of my favorite sources! Particularly for the extensive testing and data he has published. I still have his book, even though it’s for swimming. It’s a great presentation on the interplay of the energy systems and how an improvement in one domain, can result in a regression in the other and how he feels one should approach and balance that. Acknowledging I’m putting the cart ahead of the horse, if people have lactate meters and wanted to include that data, they certainly could! I don’t know how many of us have a meter though? I wouldn’t want to exclude anyone interested based on that prerequisite. Also, I don't know why I'm talking like I'm in charge of this haha. It would certainly require a concerted group effort. I think the main motivator behind this group idea would be to see how consistent CTL is in establishing a personal relationship between the level achieved and performance, as well as does it matter how you reach that CTL level (i.e. your intensity distribution) and at what point does a positive linear relationship, assuming it exists, potentially uncouple. Either way, this has the makings of a fine science fair project, pulled off by the most unlikely group of randos ever haha P.S. Regarding the lactate and VO2Max, I’ve not seen a specific equation from Olbrecht on a large generalized scale. Was that maybe in the paper he published on the 900 swimmers he tested? Regardless, yes, since both are a function of speed, having the two equations (preferably on a large sample scale) allows you to express VO2 as a function of lactate (or visa versa). Most of what I’ve seen from him is on swimmers though, so I’m not sure how transferable that specific mathematical relationship would be with runners? Meaning, there may be sport specific variations in the metrics.",

I do take much better care of my body though now: eat better, no drinking and lifting consistently. And the original quote I responded to is correct, outside of pro runners, we all have time constraints that make ideal training difficult. I think the pluses are, I’m not overcooked in workouts ever and I’ve realized I was probably running way too quick on recovery days in essence not actually recovering.

What do you all think of warmups? I saw in Bakken’s correspondences with Gjert Ingebrigsten that he didn’t think warmups were necessary, but I’ve seen no downside to doing them. I did another session around a grass field that I don’t know the exact distance off, and after a 25 minute or so warmup, I ran 6 reps at around 3:50 ± only 3 seconds (60s). Maybe the lower time spread was because of the longer warmup and my aerobic lactate/metabolite clearing capabilities had “ramped up” as another poster put it. I use an analog watch, so I don’t have accurate mid-rep splits, and I think I’ve gotten pretty good at feeling the necessary intensity if my reps were that close together without looking at the time/pace at all within the reps.

    "message": "@lactate_boi Thanks for clarifying and further elaborating! I figured it was the 200m or 400m repeats you were referring to but it’s interesting and noteworthy that even for a MLSS test, below MLSS, you typically see a drop in the reading after the first test point too. @_vance With regard to your question, I don’t know how you’d target a lactate level without a meter? I’ve played around with taking my lactate curve and plugging the speeds that generate different lactate values into Daniels VO2 formula to see at what percent of VO2Max do those values occur and if they are consistent with others lactate data. There appears just too much variation for my taste to suggest matching paces to lactate levels that way though, in general. Duration plays a role in lactate too, especially when faster than your MLSS. Olbrecht has a plot (for running) that shows the lactate variation above MLSS when using 3, 5, or 7 minute intervals. While VO2 is stable for all three durations, lactate varies significantly. Conversely, Olbrecht also has a plot (for swimming) of a 6*200m w/ 30 sec recovery where the lactate drops successively with each repeat (from 4.0 mmol to 2.5 mmol), for a workout done at a pace just slightly faster (I believe 102% V4, compared to 99% V4 for the 400m, where V4 is velocity at 4.0 mmol). Point being, you can achieve whatever you want really, it just depends on the execution. As an additional point, part of the reason the initial lactate is higher and then settles (or even drops) when the pace is constant, is the aerobic-anaerobic energy contribution due to the minimal recovery. On the first repeat, you’re starting from rest, so the initial ~1.5-2 minutes is being supplied “anaerobically” while each successive repeat is being started at a higher level of rest due to the incomplete recovery thereafter, thus requiring a lower percent of “anaerobic” contribution. So, how long your aerobic system takes to “ramp up” is dependent on the workout structure.",

The time to work down to marathon + pace would be progressively decreased each week depending on your current fitness levels, this increases your time near marathon pace, you should also think about increasing the total length of the session depending on how long this session is, ideally 2 hours to 2 hours 30 mins depending on your marathon expected finishing time.

So, if the intensity is fixed, you need to increase the duration to increase the TSS. If the duration is fixed, you need to increase the intensity, whether that is %HRmax or %FTP. I agree, saying your LTHR is X% of HRmax is meaningless without a reference to something that represents pace, speed, or power.

I probably shouldn't run by pace, yet it is easy to do on a treadmill. If I run outside on day 3 or 5 I just do the intervals by feel (even the duration), trying to remember feels from the treadmill. I don't like looking at my phone and don't own a sports watch. Essentially this takes the whole thing and bases it off simply the Tinman calculator. It might be foolish still but I think I am getting closer to something that works for me and is a good mix of simple and intuitive with constant reality checks.",

He is planning I believe to run very soon again, so we will see how it pans out. You definitely need a running background though, as I did a duathlon years ago on zero running and whilst I managed double sub 20s back to back, I couldn't walk for like 3 days after.

What I'd recommend is establishing your FTP if you have a power meter/smart trainer and riding easy at 70% of said FTP. Training by HR on the bike can be tricky, as any given HR inferred from running would translate to a much harder stress on the bike. So don't try to mimic your running zones on the bike, it would just trash you, especially for quality sessions (I thought my +9 mmol/L readings were wrong after I tried to bike using my running sub threshold HR on the bike being untrained for the specificity of cycling). Fortunately I managed to preserve some fitness, and got my CTL back and even a point ahead of where I was pre-injury, but how that translates to running remains to be seen.",

Overtime your heart rate at pace X will go down as you get fitter. If you calculate TSS based on heart rate, this means your TSS at running pace X will go down over time, which in turn means your CTL / \"fitness\" score will also go down over time. But this would be an absurd result since you are clearly getting fitter as your heart rate decreases for pace X. Some will say the incremental stimulus from running at pace X decreases as you get fitter and if you always run at pace X, after a long enough time, you aren't building fitness. But this is already baked into how CTL is calculated. If you base TSS off of pace, then every time you run at pace X you get the same exact TSS, and over time your CTL will plateau and remain flat.",

By HR, it could be 70 (I've seen lower), or 80 (i saw higher when i was ill running workouts). If you stick to the paces, it'll be more consistent and in my experience a fairer reflection of your overall increase (hopefully) in CTL and training. Pace, as long as you are running the same routes most sessions or the same paces on say a treadmill, are the best way I've managed to replicate power over the bigger picture. However, if you want to use HR, that's not a problem. But do not mix and match how you calculate TSS. It only holds value, if you use the same way each time you run. On top of that, TSS is only meaningful to you, it's absolutely worthless to compare it from person to person. This comes back to why I think a lot of people have dismissed it as a metric over the years (even cyclists). I can't believe I'm quoting Coggan, but I've seen him say before, garbage in, garbage out. The only way this is useful if 1. You have picked a metric to stick to, 2. If you are you using pace, you stick to however you want to calculate your \"threshold\" pace in intervals.

BTW, did you find your similar CTL value corresponds to similar performance in the race?

I wasn't alone in being able to index CTL to performance, but it totally replies on good data in, good data out. This is where the vast majority of people fall short of having any meaningful sets of numbers, even to themselves. Or get confused thinking \"My CTL is 100, that guy's is 70, he's just caught me for a minute in a time trial. CTL is dumb\". It's only meaningful and compatible, to yourself. FWIW, I found 1.5w per one CTL increase was pretty standard for me, once you smooth out the curve. There will be a point where it doesn't increase the same, but on part time training, I never reached that. I've mentioned here before, but a few of us looked into it and the performance based on the worst conceivable way versus the best way to gain CTL, was only maybe maximum 10%. So in a sense, more is more , until you reach the point you are just naturally capped. I would imagine that's more hours than any of us here (in this thread anyway) are willing to put in. For running, the performance versus CTL isn't quite as neat. But, in general, we are talking a handful of seconds or maybe slightly more from my 5k time, per km CTL increase. But I don't have a huge amount of data on this - also with the caveat of I've never gone back to zero. So that's an increase from a benchmark of 40 CTL, in both ways I have trained for the same race result (a high 18). Hope that helps or sort of answered your question.",

    "message": "The reason this has happened is his previous training was Jack Daniels based (right? or am I misunderstanding?) which means a majority of his race prep training was done at Hard Tempo (roughly half marathon to 10k effort (slower pace)), 5k pace, and mile pace. These all train type IIX fibers maximally (half marathon - 10k also trains IIb fibers very well, the other paces only slightly do this). This Norwegian Training System focuses on workouts from marathon (+) to 10k pace/effort, which trains the type IIb fibers very well, but not only that, it also , which in turn increases ability at any race between the Marathon and the 3k directly (raises your Critical Power/Anaerobic Threshold and vVO2 Max). This is also why you may feel less \"explosive\" during true base/threshold training. Your top end speed should remain relatively similar, however, your anaerobic tolerance decreases for anything over roughly 200m (150-250m depending on your training and genetics). If you don't maintain some form of speedwork, your top end speed will also begin to deteriorate. This brings me to why the Norwegians include hill sprints. Efforts faster than vVO2 Max that leave you \"huffin and puffin\" (ie 20x200m HARD Hills w/ 2x time jog rec.) actually begin to In general, as a long distance runner, this is . This means your fatigue resistance will decrease and you will become more glycogen dependent the more you do this. : This is important to understand, because if you do things right, you will increase your potential as a runner. Many people point to SirPoc doing \"traditional\" training and then improving massively with threshold training and while this \"threshold fitness\" is more suited to long distance racing and he could've done well without the harder intervals to begin with, these hard/grueling workouts were a different type of \"base\" for this threshold work. This is the reverse of \"I tried Lydiard high mileage, but I didn't race well, so I dropped my mileage and went back to my hard interval training and ran the best I ever have!\". But in this case, SirPoc dropped the hard intervals (and didn't increase mileage a ton) and improved quite a lot with Now, are these hard workout necessary to PB in 5k and up? the simple answer is , however, your potential will not increase, you will only squeeze out more from your potential instead of adding to it. If you were to add a tough anaerobic workout you may become weaker aerobically, but you will perform better at the 3k and under, while also increasing your potential at the 5k and up. Now, you might ask, and then answer is : (marathon pace ish). This does take away from your Type IIx fibers! But don't forget to train your Type IIx fibers (sprints) otherwise they deteriorate. In short, exceptional Distance Racing between 3 hours and 3 minutes requires exceptional Type IIb Fibers, you get Type IIb fibers Type IIx fibers, and you get Type IIx fibers from Type I fibers. Threshold training allows you to use your potential (in distance running), everything else increases your potential. A side note, this is why anything between Aerobic Threshold and Critical Power/Anaerobic Threshold is not always a good idea for 800m runners. As a 800m runner, you don't want extra Type IIb fibers, you want primarily Type IIx fibers, but you still want to train the Type IIb fibers you have (endurance is still important in an 800m) and you do this by training between your Critical Power/Anaerobic Threshold and your vVO2 Max, hence the 800m \"Base\" consisting of Easy Running below the Aerobic Threshold, vVo2 Max Work, and Sprint work. This then transitions into Lactate Tolerance work and such, etc. Continuing off the 800m training idea, this is why you cannot run a (relatively) good 800m when you are in (relatively) great Marathon to 5k Shape. The most obvious case is Jakob Ingebgritsen who, when running at the Prefontaine Diamond League meet, ran 3:43 in the Mile and 7:23 in the 3k. This puts him at approximately 26:20s 10k shape (in the same condtions, time trial, and rested shape). I would then estimate he could \"only\" run 1:45 (ish) in the 800m, which is incredibly fast, but slow when compared to knocking on the door of a world record in the mile. The thing here is, Jakob Ingebrigtsen is only \"slow\" because of the way he train, if he wanted to be a good 800m 1500m runner, he could be, but he would have to give up his world record ability racing shape at anything above the 3k, because he would have to convert back to Type IIx fibers (3 - 15 min race pace training). A counter-example to Ingebrigtsen is Nick Willis, who was able to run very fast 1500m races (sub 3:30), a decent 800m (1:45 when his 1500m PR was 3:32), and a lethal kick in championship races. When Nick Willis tried to transition to the 5k, he failed. This was partly because he was older, but mostly because He most likely did similar \"Miler\" training with more volume, rather than a slower pace/effort. This is also why Gjert has been known to say, Anyways, sorry for the ramble, but this has been on my mind a lot lately and I am open to discussion on any points I made as I'm sure I have made an error somewhere.",

And fibers do not change so fast with a snap of your finger. There is no clear scientific evidence that slow twitch fibers can be transfered into fast twitch fibers, as also the motor units who activate the fibers, would have to change too. Also fast twitch fibers do not change to slow twitch fibers that quickly, but that seems possible. Most experts believe that slow twitch fibers can not be transfered to fast twitch fibers.

The addition of muscle fibers, primarily type I, has been shown and is the basic idea of hyperplasia. The transition from Type I to Type IIx is a real phenomenon as well, but requires grueling workouts in a specific intensity zone (above vVO2 Max). At no point did I say this was fast like you imply. I implied this could take years and I only ever said you can transition fibers, increasing or decreasing each type, I didn't say a slow twitch hobby jogger could be a world class sprinter, but you also have guys like Narve Nordas who had \"no talent\" in his own words and then runs sub 3:30 after a few years of this stuff.

He then stated that the 25x400 session could be run at a faster pace (approx. 10K?) while remaining at LT than could the 2K reps. If he's been doing the typical 400s workout done within the Norwegian Method, he's probably running within 10-15 sec/mile of what he held for 5K. And, with the great aerobic focus/development of this training method, he's likely to stay more aerobic late into the race, and therefore able to pick up the pace and use the speed he naturally possesses, whatever that level is. Speed through Strength, so to speak. Also, with this type of training, he's not going to be beat up going into competition, which is often the case with traditional 5K training.

May just be that it took a lot of time and training in general (Norwegian style or not) to make that skill transition, or maybe this specific training better suited his talent/training background in that regard, or maybe some combination of factors. I do think that there's an underrated aspect of running \"relaxed\" in workouts, beyond just getting more training in, that this Norwegian style basically forces people into while something more \"conventional\" like Daniels training doesn't necessarily do well. We think of that mostly in terms of not overcooking things metabolically (i.e. staying under the lactate threshold), but I think there's a neuromuscular aspect to it as well. To race well we need the skill of running relaxed and economically, which probably isn't trained well if we are straining at the limit of our ability in really hard intervals. Even if we are running something at a \"race pace\", if our biomechanics are strained we may not be training a style of running that is sustainable in an actual race. Doing a bunch of relatively chill tempo intervals gives us just enough stress to practice efficient biomechanics at fast paces while not being so stressful that it's hard to run smoothly. In a way, this has a sort of skill \"specificity\" even if the pace is not race-specific per se. Kinda a half-cooked ramble there but could be something to consider.",

Training discussion tends to be dominated by recreational marathoning coming from a Daniels/Pfitz/Higdon/Hansons background. I commonly link to this thread when someone asks some version of the \"how do I double threshold\" question, because of course the answer to that question for 99.9% of people asking it is \"you shouldn't do double threshold, but here's a good way to use some similar principles.\" While I don't really subscribe to this exact method per se, I do preach a lot of similar values in the Reddit running subs -more threshold, threshold intervals, back-off the paces slightly, anti-gut busting VO2 max intervals, anti-slugging out huge long runs, etc. In particular, a lot of people have a really tough time even considering that their heroic VO2 max intervals and huge long runs might be counterproductive in many cases, which may explain the lack of interest in a method that pretty much entirely ditches both.",

    "message": "Excellent thoughts in these 2 posts! I agree that Sirpoc must definitely be suited to pure LT training, as most runners would at least need some strides or hills at 5K race effort or faster to perform optimally. Kinda makes you wonder if Sirpoc could go even faster with a touch of faster stuff, but as long as he keeps improving, and is enjoying what he's doing, not much sense in that. I'm a 64 year old retired runner (and current HS XC coach) with 2 total knee replacements, so I no longer run. But, I'm a devoted rower, and have been following an \"age-adjusted\" Norwegian Method plan for many months. I use a 10 day cycle that includes 2 LT sessions (one longer reps & one shorter reps), one X-Factor day (what I'd call mile-specific for a runner), and plenty of easy rowing, elliptical, biking, walking on the other days. The schedule looks like this: 1. Short LT Reps (30-90 seconds/30 sec rests. Kept @ LT effort/HR) 2. Easy Aerobic 3. Easy Aerobic: may insert a few really relaxed 15 second pick-ups 4. Long LT Reps (3-8 minutes kept @ LT effort/HR) 5. Easy Aerobic 6. Easy Aerobic: may insert a few really relaxed 15 second pick-ups 7. X-Factor Day: Generally 30-60 second intervals @ 4 minute race effort 8. Off Day or Easy Aerobic 9, Easy Aerobic 10.Easy Aerobic: may insert a few really relaxed 15 second pick-ups Repeat.... I can honestly say that while following this schedule, I never have bad days. When I first started doing this kind of training about a year ago, I tried doing a quality session every other day, but found that this led to a lot of residual fatigue (probably due to age). As soon as I started buffering the LT days with 2 easy aerobic days, and followed the X-Factor day with 3 easy aerobic days, I started feeling really good all of the time. Anyway, great informative thread. Nice that it's continued with posters who are really trying to learn and contribute!",

    "message": "Wonderful. I hope things work for you. And maybe this will work. But I hope you know the real training \"secret\": String together a couple of years of consistent running (6 days a week), following the usual principles: sleep enough; eat right; don't add volume too fast; don't add workout volume or intensity too fast. Have cutback weeks. After a race or season, figure out the kind of break you need (full break for a week or two? Or just a couple of days off after a marathon, a really light remainder of the first week, and then 3-4 weeks of easy running with a gradual return to previous mileage? Everyone is different). You could do that with Daniels, Pfitzinger, Hansons, or some other good plan and see progress, but consistency and good habits are the key for any of those. The same applies to this method, but maybe your body will respond better to this one. And maybe you'll find that it resonates with you in a way that actually builds your ability to remain with it consistently. But there's no magic plan that overcomes inconsistency. If you find yourself caught back in the trap of doing exactly what coaches advise against (and nearly all of us have lapsed into that at least a little bit at some time), then you won't get the results you want. And although you can set goals over any time frame, remember that your job is to train exactly the way you're supposed to train today (or rest today, or whatever), according to your fitness, plan, and and the way you feel -- and to make the right kind of incremental progress by doing so. And over time, that will all add up to something you'll like a lot. The success won't just come to you years down the line, either. If you adopt the consistent approach with a view toward sustaining it over the long haul, you'll probably be surprised at your progress over intermediate stages, too. (incidentally, this probably isn't a news flash, but I think nearly any coach could turn the vast majority of 30 min. 5k runners into 24 min. 5k runners via any number of training styles if the runner commits to good, consistent training habits. You don't have a lot of people running a 30 min 5k because they follow the wrong plan; they run that because they don't follow a plan, or they don't know how to follow the plan well (e.g., \"easy means easy\"/\"train, don't strain\").",

The progression of one runner is indeed impressive but it is just a sample of 1 at this point so perhaps let's not jump to conclusions on how this is the best \"system\" bar none. I am 37, training consistently for 18 months after running recreationally for a while and have seen substantially the same progression as Sirpoc, while doing a bit of everything in terms of training.

    "message": "That’s fine, and that may work really well for you. But in my own view of consistent training, I would say the answer is less rigidly “stay at 35-40 mpw for now” than just related to following broad principles of what to do and not to do. But I suppose a lot depends on what time frame you mean by “for now,” as well as what your upcoming schedule is (I believe you have a spring goal race). E.g., I think at one point you may have asked about whether you could skip base building and head right into workouts. That would be a no. And I think you’ve had a nice attitude toward your plan of using a workout as fitness tests, but it looks like you might’ve done 5 x 1600 fairly early in your inclusion of workouts. That looks like potentially high volume early for a workout, but I don’t know: maybe you prepped your body for it over the course of weeks. And anyway, that’s water under the bridge now. And maybe settling in on mileage right now is fine. Or you could probably go with small incremental increases for a couple of weeks, do a cutback, return and maintain for a few weeks; rinse and repeat. That would be a conservative way to build. (or look at Daniel’s percentages, or just follow a plan that builds that mileage for you, or whatever). But there are lots of good options. The key is recognizing and avoiding less constructive options. And those less constructive ways usually follow the impulse of: ”must hit X goal in race Y weeks away” unless you really know for a fact that you’ve been building well toward that goal on that timeframe. I’ve mentioned more about mileage here because I was taken aback by your previous statement that you might need upwards of 80 mpw because you knew what 35-50 gets you. I suppose it’s possible that you had a really sensible view of that, but I feared that you would possibly push above 50 mpw way too soon. And I disagree strongly with the statement that you know what up to 50 mpw gets you. You had some decent results with similar mileage, but even when you got fit fast and did pretty well, you felt a little bit let down as a result of a few hitches in training and then poor pacing. And then over time, you had a series of long layoffs, sometimes through absolutely no fault of your own. And although you learned a lot along the way and made some improvements, I don’t think you have quite had the chance to follow best practices consistently in the course of bouncing back from any of those layoffs yet. And so you still haven’t had the chance to show up on the line ready to race according to the fitness you gained in training, then been able to see the results of that via a well-paced race. And you certainly haven’t been able to do that multiple cycles in a row. Doing that is what gives a runner insight into what a particular mileage range gets you. And I expect you’re all prepped and set up to find out what good, consistent training gets you. Good luck.",

I was obviously wrong in my statement. :) I'd love to do Chicago someday. One woman I know ran 3:05 and another one ran 3:19:55--in both cases, these Chicago runners had perfect, evenly paced races in 2022 and 2023, respectively. And some men I knew were even faster, in the 2:50-3:00 range, on that course.

    "message": "For reference I started following the thread in December 2023. I loosely followed what sirpoc was doing, but wanted to implement double thresholds, because I have more time and wanted to try to take it as far as possible. What does it consist of? Well I do 5 x 6 minutes in the morning and 10 x 3 minutes in the afternoon on the treadmill consistently every Tuesday and Thursday, all off of 60 seconds standing. Monday is easy, Wednesday easy, Friday easy, Saturday some faster hill stuff and Sunday easy long. I scrapped the 400m repeats early on, because I just felt that I wasn't getting much threshold benefit from them due to how short the reps were, and also it just felt strange doing them on the treadmill. I haven't invested in lactic readings due to the price, but instead used Max HR and LTHR to chart these paces originally. So for reference my max HR is quite high at around 210-211, the idea is to keep everything under 190 HR at the very highest which is around LTHR (might be closer to 192-193 but I'm keeping it on the safe side). I'm taking mean readings from the last 2 minutes of every rep and aiming to keep that average per session around 172-175 for these readings. If my HR is lower than 172 consistently over a few sessions then I know its time to up the pace, if its higher than 175 then it's mostly just due to gym temperature, or bad days, but I know that I need to back off. So from December -> March I started with doing the 5 x 6 minutes @ 3:43/km at 175HR, and 10 x 3 minutes @ 3:35/km around 175 HR too. For the first 3 weeks my HR was pretty consistent at this. Then gradually lower in the 4th week and 5th week (169-171 HR), so I upped the paces of both by .1 on the treadmill. After the first month, I started seeing pretty clear increase in fitness every single week. I wouldn't up the pace every week, but it was basically every 2nd week that I was in the position to increase pace by 0.1 on the treadmill. I haven't missed a single Tuesday or Thursday session (other than 1 week which was a down week) since I started, now my paces are 3:33/km for the 6 minutes, and 3:23/km for the 3 minutes around 172-174 HR currently. I keep all of these things documented quite rigorously on spreadsheets too. For reference it comes out to around 130-140km a week, and this is very easy to sustain for me because I am not really doing anything at a high intensity, other than the hill reps which are very low duration (usually 25 seconds). I don't really feel any fatigue build up from this and can fit everything in 50 minute sessions, other than the long run. Not had any injuries either, treadmill is very forgiving. All of my easy runs are done between 5:00/km and 4:35/km. Sometimes do long runs slightly quicker but still very much aerobic (4:20/km - 4:40/km). I haven't been running for a particularly long time either, was in 40 min 10k shape in November 2022. Since December 2023, I've gone from 16:40 -> 15:40 5k shape late March 2024. 20 Y-O. Didn't run in school or at all earlier in childhood. Not ran a 10k but assuming it would be somewhere between 3:16-3:19/km just from feel. I'm not saying that this method is flawless, and it is definitely not as scientific as lactic usage. But I'm pretty confident I will be in under 15 shape by the end of the year from this, and don't really know where after that. Maybe someone will find it useful.",

    "message": "So, for a solid four months straight, I stuck to this training routine gearing up for a half marathon. Then, in the fifth month, I tweaked it a bit to prep for a full-on marathon. Like I mentioned earlier, I simplified things while keeping the core structure intact: Monday: Easy jog for 8-11 km Tuesday: Did 10 x 3min intervals, cruising at a pace between 10 km and half marathon pace Wednesday: Another chill run, 8-11 km Thursday: Hammered out 5 x 6min intervals at a half marathon pace Friday: Took it easy again with 8-11 km Saturday: 3 x 10min intervals, just a tad slower than half marathon pace Sunday: 75-95 minutes long, a bit quicker than usual but still cruising in Zone 2. For intervals days I had 3km warm up and only 1km chill down. Rest between intervals 60-90 sec. Come February, I was all set for a half marathon, aiming for at least 1:18:xx. But man, did things go south after the halfway mark. Looking back at the data, it was clear I wasn't in top form that day. My heart rate was way too high from the get-go compared to my training days from a week ago, and I used chest strap for precise readings. Hit a 3:43 pace at the halfway mark, but the second half turned into a survival mode slog, finishing in 1:21. After that disappointing half, I had a mere four weeks to gear up for a full-blown marathon in Rome. I decided to tweak the plan by easing up on the Saturday run and stretching out the long run to over 30 km, keeping it slightly below marathon effort for 15-20 km of it. This was my third crack at a marathon, with my last one clocking in at 2:58:45 about a year and a half ago. My heart rate in those previous marathons averaged 162 bpm, so this time, I capped it at 160 bpm until the 30 km mark. Crossed the finish line in 2:54:09, and boy, did I still have some gas left in the tank. Last 700 meters, I was flying at a 3:29 pace. And get this, all of this was done with just three long runs - 30 km, 35 km, and 32 km. So, yeah, turns out this method isn't just good for up to half marathons - it works pretty well for the full marathons too. I was smashed after my first 2 marathons, but this one went butter smooth. I had no idea marathon could be that easy on the body. I was back at full training mode on Tuesday. My advice? Stick to the base training, like I did for the first four months, then maybe start prepping specifically for the marathon about a month earlier than I did to get in more long runs. But hey, I was dead set on smashing that half marathon PR just two weeks before the full marathon, so there you go! I got my next attempt at setting new half marathon PR in 3 weeks. I hope that it won't be too warm, since I am pretty temperature sensitive",

When I got out of the bathroom I was behind the 3:30 group at mile 3, was able to catch them at mile 7 and then just paced evenly from there--1:42:50/1:42:54--that is as perfect as you can get. I closed a 7:05 at mile 25. During the race I saw it as a test to see if I could get stronger from 32k on...it was fun. Closed in 47 instead of 49-50 like I normally do the last 10k! No bonking due to taking SIX gels instead of 3-4 like in 2019, 2021 and 2022. Tonight I saw what I could do with the sub-threshold principles and did 3x2 at current HMP by effort w/2m rest. HR was higher, of course, but it was a good pace checkup. Legs tight on the first 2--7:35/7:35, but used the 2m rest to do more active stretching Then the last 4 felt great--7:26/7:17 (rest) and 6:58/6:58 6 in 43:30. Tinman calc has me at 1:40:32 or whatevs with that 43:30--I'll be happy if I'm under 1:40. 1:30 can wait until next year. 10k is probably around 45, 15k around 69-70. In January I did 4 miles in 41 (!), I was that out of shape. My fault, no excuses. I'll have to do this year-round going forward and I see that...",

Since he’d need to pace 1:40 half runners too, he wouldn’t be able to do anything like a negative split, so it’s hard to get much better even pacing than that. On that workout: nice job, but maybe I’m missing something about how you’re calculating pace with Tinman. As I understand it, if you ran half marathon pace/effort, then that would be your half marathon pace, which would give you something like 1:36-1:37 half shape now. I see above 1:40:30 for the Tinman calculator only from that time for a 6-mile tapered, all-out race, which is not what I think you did. So you might be in better shape than you thought yesterday.

    "message": "This is great! What I love about this thread is that the OP's first inquiry was downvoted a bunch, yet some thoughtful Letsrunners enlivened the conversation with their constructive contributions. Would love to hear more on this thread from folks who've seen success from doing this over the long term. For me, I have been training for the mile (although always been too slow for a miler) using this method, and I felt like my 1500-mile times were stagnating for a while as I raised my CTL with 3x threshold weekly – however, my 5k and above times were dropping rapidly, and my mile splits were more consistent! The instant I subbed one threshold session for hill repeats and some specific track sessions, my shorter distance times also dropped much quicker than usual. So, for next training block I am learning for myself that I can keep doing the 3x threshold to get really strong for a while, then only minor tweaks later on can give me the muscular strength/coordination to hit those faster paces. I guess what I'm realizing is that the fear I had of not improving at short distances from doing mostly threshold work isn't totally warranted – just need to add some \"tuning\" or \"sharpening\" workouts, and the times have still dropped. I used to hit the track twice weekly with threshold and hard VO2 work mixed in, but did not see the same improvement, I think likely because the mile is still highly aerobic, and much like sirpoc's early comments, my earlier CTL was much lower. My takeaway from this personal experience is that there's a layer of high-end aerobic work in the program that works so reliably, and tweaking the program slightly to meet the anaerobic demands of the 800-mile can yield great results after months of doing threshold-heavy work. Thanks all for a great, informative thread.",

I bet if you're conservative about your workouts (like around marathon pace), you could do sub-thresholds every other day – so you'll have some weeks where there are three (Tues, Thurs, Sat) workouts but others where you have four (Mon, Wed, Fri, Sun)...then back to three the next week with Tues, Thurs, Sat.",

Never quote tips me over, some weeks I could maybe manage a 4th, sometimes not. I guess the 4th on an every other day could work, but I think it's risky. Remember, this really is about gaining as much load as you can, in the quickest and most efficient way, without ever burning out. I'm still going good, injury free. Only COVID as stopped me in the last 18 months . It's always tempting to be greedy though and increase load, I come up with madcap ideas all the time then stop myself and go back to what I know works. It's easily all overthinked. I did try and make Hard2find run marathon pace 30 mins everyday to see what would happen, but then one never got off the ground ha ha If anyone does try anything a bit more aggressive, would be interesting to hear their medium to long term feedback. This is the contradiction, if I was cycling I have done 5+ of these sessions in a week, when you are quick building after some time off, all at sweetspot (which is what sub threshold is, it's just taken on a new name). But one thing I have really learned, is the demands of running are no joke. Now where there might be something interesting to look into and room for experimentation - is what Jiggy and Shirtboy are up to at the moment, as they are actually incorporating a lot of cycling into their week, to get in quite a bit more work. Early indications, are good, but you still need a decent amount of running on top of that, to keep you a \"runner\" first and foremost. What the balance is, I'm not sure. They are still very much experimenting as they go. The irony, I'm the one doing no cycling.",

I might add, totally NOT endorsing that as a good idea, but re referencing to the fact sub threshold holds nothing particularly special about what it does, only that is probably the easiest way in running so far, that anyone has discovered creates the most manageable load, over a long period of time, for most people (not all). If running a Vo2 max sessions a week and running a long straight tempo a week created more load and felt doable, I'd be doing that. But it doesn't and isn't .",

Someone running 40 mpw should be doing less volume. Don't rush into the highest volume in a single session. Accumulate enough stress throughout many sessions. It is much safer that way.

(remark: i do not say it is the only area where you should train) P.S: And the hate against Tinman i do not understand.",

To me it seems like people have realized that there's a lot to be gained by running at threshold pace for a few reasons. It's easier on your body to repeat week after week. It provides the most bang for buck of all aerobic training. The workouts themselves are easier to execute as you're never truly straining. Does this sound right? Before anyone ever muttered the phrase \"Norwegian Method\" or \"Double Threshold,\" I experimented with my training after college. I was BAD at \"tempo\" runs in college. We'd do like 3–4 miles @ 5:10-5:30. I blew up so many times. When I could complete them on pace, it was damn near a race effort. After college I trained on my own, and found out that if I ran around 5:50-6:10 pace, I could do that once or twice a week for a tempo run and it was not only easier, it was kind of enjoyable. I didn't even have a GPS watch, my pace was just me guessing based off experience and occasionally doing a few laps of the track in the middle of the run as a pace check. I would go up to 35 minutes doing this, getting in more volume than ever at a \"tempo\" pace. I referred to this as my \"comfortably hard tempo run.\" I went on to set some middle distance PRs incorporating this into my training. I still did some 5k pace work, and of course I did race pace and speed development work too, but I think it was important that these weekly tempo sessions were something I could do over and over again, and get a tiny bit better each week. Did I accidentally stumble into the \"Norwegian Method\"? Was that threshold effort? Was my mind in the right place? Curious what people here might think.",

    "message": "The trolls in this thread do make me laugh. I always raise a smile every few days when I try and check in on this thread over my morning coffee and they have tried to get a bite of the fishing hook. But, I'm general this thread has been good natured and in the spirit it's intended. The thing that always makes me laugh is when trolls call us \"geeks\" or \"losers\" . As if coming on a running forum is cool in the first place, or as if running is even cool to the general population (spoiler, it's not, they think we are ALL losers 🤣🤣) That's a good question/ point regarding the shoes. But my initial post, I believe still stands as a good guide. Take 1k repeats at 12-15k pace. It was based on my race time, in average carbon shoes (original rocket x) and my workouts were mainly in average carbon shoes (carbon x 3). I'm using faster shoes now, but, proportionally the % of race pace is going to remain the same, the faster shoes just give me a proportional boost in both the workout and the race. I hope that answers your question, but it was actually a good point and shoes are definitely a huge factor here. The narrow sub threshold window we are running in ( if you are using pace as a guide) would be very much affected if you are doing all your workouts in average but comfortable daily trainer, but your race paces coming from elite super shoes. This is where, obviously, absolutely ideally in the best case scenario, you would measure lactate, as they will absolutely tell you where you are, rather than guesstimating for practicality purposes via the use of my pace guides. As remember , there is not actually any real thing as a sub threshold pace, it's just a mixture of different paces and combinations of times that get you into a sub lactate state. The only thing that can actually tell you 100% for sure is the lactate meter. It must be noted , however, I haven't really deviated away from the paces I shared originally. I'll do 1k repeats today and I still will be targeting 12-15k pace. I also haven't bothered measuring lactate in a long, long time. I got to the point where 90% of my runs when I tested lactate, were in and around the numbers I wanted to see. So I basically said to myself, that'll do. Saved me the money of buying strips and just accepted if 9/10 runs got me to where I need to be based on following paces, I'm happy with that. As for the podcast. I really don't know why people are that interested in my training. But I have had 3 people message me so far about pods, but unfortunately my laziness to really respond properly or provide a time to do it (this was mostly around Christmas when I was busy) meant nothing every happened, despite the interest. Unlike Hard2find, I'm not that hard to find so I'm sure if anyone is interested they can contact me and we can try and actually arrange something. I won't mention the name, but one of the podders I have a brief chat with over email must have read this thread, but not really understood it. Or probably just briefly saw \"Norwegian\" and started talking Jakob etc. I don't know why, but this still keeps coming up. This is basically closer (in fact it definitely is) to what a British cycling time trialist might do, than to what Jakob does and his weekly schedule with doubles. What I still envisioned all this for, is older ish runners who have a busy life and maybe could run once a day for an hour and slightly longer at the weekend. If I was doing what Jakob was doing or what Bakken suggested via doubles, I would absolutely not be running any of these paces mentioned. Singles. This is very much singles and 3x workouts 3 different days a week .",

    "message": "All CTL is is an average of the TSS (workout dress scoring) over the past N days, usually 42. TSS is just a scoring system that ranks workouts relative to an hour at MLSS. It’s just a way to numerically describe your workouts and track stress and how much work to do today. Basically, track the average stress over the past 6 weeks (CTL) and try to increase it at a slow and steady rate until you can’t handle the daily stress anymore. By planning workout TSS, you can control the stress increase (ramp rate-TSS/day increase) and walk the fine line of progressive overload without overdosing on workout stress.",

    "message": "I wanted to share some personal results of the method after few months of testing. A bit of context, I am 57 yo and obviously I am not in a phase where I can progress much, but my objective would be to be under 40 min at 60 yo for 10k and under 1h30 on the half. 25 years ago I used a traditional method of training like Tuesday short intervals, Thursday long intervals, and weekend a medium long run, and was happy of the results with a low milage. After 50 yo and many years without any serious training I started again to train and improve up to about 41-42 min for 10k. Then I tried the Easy Interval Method, it was nice for the training but the results in competition were disappointing. I then went to a more Canova inspired method and went back to my level before starting EIM. Then, I read this thread, and thought why not try it (unlike people critizing without trying) as there was enough time before my first competition in March. The advantage for the evaluation of a training method is that I do a serie of 10k races that are more or less the same every year, so beside the weather change I can really compare the results. First race beginning of March: I finish more than 1 min faster than last year (at 57 , on 10K it is very significant). Very happy with the result, and the race went very well, I felt comfortable. The fact that I could run in a small group was an advantage compared to the previous year, so I think let's see what it will be on next race. The next race was yesterday. But the conditions were very different than last year. Last year the temperature was 9C (48F) and yesterday 24C (75F). Also yesterday it was the first day of the year that it was warm so no possible to get used to the warmth before. Because of this, I was not optimistic to do a good performance. Nevertheless, I finished 20 sec faster than last year when many people finished 1 min slower than last year. So, that confirms IMO the result from the first race. Conclusion: it seems that the method works well for me, even at an old age with many years of training behind. My training: I use the 3 following workouts: 10 x 3 min rest 1 min, 5 x 6 min rest 1min30, 3 x 10 min rest 2 min. 1 rest day per week on average (sometimes 2 and sometimes more when on holidays...) Usually I won't do 3 workouts every week, if optimal it will be more 5 workouts in 2 weeks.",

If you do one interval session a week and mostly easy running to get to 35mpw, modifying to sub-threshold for that one day probably won't improve your performances. You're running 17:45, and that is a solid level for 35mpw and only 1 day of intensity. Unless you are pushing your easy runs, this is a very manageable amount of training. But the idea instead might be to go from 1 to 2 interval sessions (or even 3) with the bulk of them being sub-threshold. Now you have added more quality running to your 35 -40mpw (it should go up a bit with this added workout), and you should be able to handle it because the intensity will be somewhat reduced. It will take some time, but you should see some improvement. Instead of 3 miles of faster than easy pace per week, you might end up being at 6.5-7.",

I suspect he will have some disappointing results coming up as I don't now see how he can do anymore. Not that 33 isn't an incredible PB that most of us would kill for, but I think now KI has shown to jump to the next level you should probably take the extra injury risk and include some speed work.",

However I think (provided you notice some improvements in your threshold workouts or in your races) just gradually doing your workouts faster will keep on providing the needed stimulus. so for example Sirpoc does more km per session just because his 10x1k or 6x1.6k has improved basically each month. It is also a good point that as your aerobic capacity improve you should also be able to do longer (timewise) threshold workouts, so if you have time I guess you can go up to 11x1k , 12x1k etc.. Again I don't really follow that model but my usual 3x3k sesssion has now morphed into a 4x3k. But if you have only 1h to spend for each session, just doing them faster gradually like sirpoc does seem to be the way ? I don't think there is a limit to how much threshold/sub threshold work can be beneficial for you but certainly if someone is able to reach 3x15km of threshold work per week consistently I think it means he is pretty fast and able to reach very good results in competition already.",

In a study they were a part of conducted by their physiologist (Leif Inge Tjelta?) their father was quoted as saying they spent their younger years focused predominantly on their aerobic capacity with very limited anaerobic intervals/running. If you follow the development of KI, he has done the same, basically maximizing his MLSS/60 min/Half Marathon race pace and after now only having very slight improvements, he is incorporating the next step: anaerobic training. I think sirpoc (without the injury) may begin to realize he could also take this step if he wants his 5k to keep improving (not very necessary for the half marathon though, if that's his main focus). The important thing to notice is how long KI spent on his aerobic capacity before all of a sudden he was able to do some pretty intense training (I remember seeing something like 20x300m hills in the last few months). Anyways, that's my 2 cents to keep the conversation going. I know it's not \"threshold singles\" focused, but I do think it applies to anyone who does this method and finds they stagnate after a while (I also think this is related to the idea of a lydiard base \"as long as possible\" before very intense training)",

We should be worrying what they are doing, not what double systems Bakken recommends for elites or what Jakob is running on running twice a day. Unless you are elite yourself, which is virtually nobody on Letsrun. If you look at sirpoc runs on Strava, we pretty much know what his LTHR is at this point. He's stimulating that from below and maybe by the end of the last rep is almost touching that. Maybe you only get 95% of the benefit of a threshold run, but the fact is as a hobby jogger he can then do that 3x a week because it is so planned and controlled despite clearly being a slave to a watch and boring. Maybe he could fit 2 full threshold runs in Daniels style, but he'd almost certainly be wrecked and overall he has got less stimulus. So it wouldn't make sense to do that. Long term the three slightly less intense runs are worth more than the two at a higher intensity. In my mind, this whole thing is basically as simple as that. For those who are interested , I've been following this thread and the progress on Strava of others in the group closely, the key take from this is that those who understand what is going on here under the hood, have made fantastic progress. The problems seem to be where people tweak it a bit or don't quite understand it in the first place, maybe they do but also over complicate it. I'm one of the many who have had fantastic success on singles doing this, I have just come down from 37 to a low 34 on my first 10k of the season. I am 42 now so I assumed by PB days were firmly in the past, considering I've been running 10 years and that PB was 8 years ago. The posts sirpoc posted on page 1 here I think stand up remarkably well, even probably nearly a year on. I don't really think he has even tweaked a huge amount himself. He is still doing the same thing, day in day out and if you look at his current workouts I'm sure there is a PB coming soon, especially at the longer distances if he has anything planned.",

I think this is what sirpoc himself said he would do should he run one. The long run was still in the easy pace guide and I needed to cut the Monday easy run to just 35-40 mins. But even with this I was good to go sub threshold by the Tuesday. In the race at about 20 miles for the first time ever I still felt strong. The aerobic engine this system creates is nothing short of spectacular, for all distances if you can stick to it over a 6 month + period. I didn't get bored myself, but I am quite autistic so repetition is part of my life ☺️",

The most recent k reps finished in 3:10. That is his 5k PR pace.

This also means there are no surprises when racing. So I would be shocked if he doesn't already know he is probably in PB shape right now, especially for 10k and up. I know on LRC we laugh at prediction workouts, but if you can run 10*1k on 1 min rest and stay under Lthr even right up to the end in 3:16 average, you clearly are going to have a great shot at sub 33 for a 10k.

    "message": "I calculate that TID (Training Intensity Distribution) for the Norwegian Method is about: 65% Endurance (Recovery, Base, Moderate efforts) for the 35% Stamina (Tempo to VO2 max efforts) over 5 workouts 5% Speed (Mile pace or faster) for the X factor workouts I think you can modify the method to those parameters for someone doing 50-70 MPW. The endurance component is very important in helping to establish the metabolic infrastructure for efficient aerobic and glycolytic processes. So to the extent that infrastructure is develop, your potential for effective lactate processing at high intensity efforts is compromised. So, I'm not sure you can continue to have an optimal rate development with this kind of programming without progressively higher volumes of aerobic development. From what I understand of how the coaches in Norway are starting thier younger runners on this method, they don't start with doubles until it's necessary to manage the increased training volume. If you've read Bakken's post on the Norwegian Method, the doiuble threshold was in response to breaking up necessary threshold training volume in to manageable workouts. Thus instead of doing a 20k tempo runs, he did two 10k volume threshold intervals with a restricted range of pace effort. To my thinking, to scale the Norwegian Method you should be looking at the training pattern and adjust the programming accordingly.",

You trained in this way and then experienced a “health scare,” but you’re not attributing the health scare to this training (hope you’re OK!). Of course, that’s because one shouldn’t necessarily infer a causal relationship in that way. Since you have some encouraging signs, if you like the training, it sounds reasonable to stick with it. I suppose any number of effects like faster/greater gains, better recovery, easier time sticking with the training week in and week out, etc. would be signs over the course of time that it’s working for you. “Over the course of time”?

He refuses to do ANY intervals, so he runs most runs at 0.9-0.95 IF (80-95% CP) and only runs slow when he's tired. Same route every day and we only adjust the time based on fatigue.

For very well seasoned/ elite runners who have extracted the juice from the two aforementioned categories, they are left with pursuing more high-intensity work to find the last bit of their potential.

It definitely isnt the latter, and most people interested enough to come read about it on the forum probably have enough mileage to rule out the purely aerobic running.",

    "message": "It's been over a year now since I started taking lactate samples. I have accumulated over a 100 samples from runs since, and a few more from stationary rides when I got injured recently. I'll keep this about running though. This become long, depending on how much I feel on rambling, so I'll add a TL,DR at the footnote of the post. Establish whether the relationship between heart rate [HR] and lactate values is strong enough (good correlation) to use it as a primary gauge for lactate-orientated training. Samples were taking by a Lactate Plus meter. Heart rate was recorded via Garmin HRM-Pro Plus chest strap. I categorized my samples into three color codes. 1- Green, which means I'm confident about the sample reading being correct. 2- Yellow, which means I'm uncertain and it might be contaminated. 3- Red, which means I'm certain the reading is wrong. A total of samples fall into the yellow category, while samples are red. That leaves samples in the green category. I also state whether the samples was taking indoor on the treadmill, or outside. The list sheet contains rows for each samples, in which the Rep distance/Rep duration/Avg Pace/Avg HR/ Max HR/Temperature/Relative Humidity/Feels Like index/Incline are also logged. Comparing the two parameters is done by plotting average heart rate on the X-axis versus lactate values on the Y-axis which is the basis for a linear regression model. The R squared coefficient is then calculated. This coefficient of determination runs from , which means there is absolutely no correlation whatsoever between the two parameters, to , which means the variance in the model can be completely explained by one of the parameters. Six sets of samples were taken into account when plotting the regression model and the subsequent correlation comparisons: Set #1: All green samples only. Set #2: All green + yellow samples. Set #3: Indoor green samples only. Set #4: Outdoor green samples only. Set #5: Indoor green + yellow samples. Set #6: Outdoor green + yellow samples. Red samples have been omitted from any analysis that affects the next section. A total of samples were taken outside, with the other samples being indoors on the treadmill. One thing to note is that 6 out of 7 red samples fall into the outside category, illustrating how sweat contamination/poor sampling technique is more prevalent outside versus inside. Set #1 coefficient is = . Set #2 coefficient is = . Set #3 coefficient is = . Set #4 coefficient is = . Set #5 coefficient is = . Set #6 coefficient is = . I have to preface by saying this is a N = 1 experiment, but I tried to keep things repeatable and thus give myself the best chance of meaningful data and thus meaningful models. I also must mention that such an analysis has limitations. I won't go into much detail about all that. Other limitations include the sampling size, which is on the lower side for smaller subsets such as \"Outdoor green samples only\". The first set has a correlation of 0.5212, which suggests that around of the variability observed in the target variable is explained by the linear regression model. In comparison, the R square coefficient drops down to 0.421 when including the yellow samples into the mix. In this case, approximately of the variance is explained by one of the model parameters, making it even less correlated. The correlation goes slightly up a few percent when we look at set #3 where the about of the variance is explained. However, the correlations go down significantly when we start looking at sets 4, 5 and 6, where the range is . Lactate levels at any HR seemed to be considerably lower on the treadmill vs outside. Secondly, even when comparing identical workouts on the treadmill in different times of the year, I could have a differential of at an identical heart rate, even when controlling for pace and weather. Case study: I compared a 6 x 1K workout done on the same treadmill. Workout #1 took place in October 2023 when I was in peak shape tapering for my HM in the middle of the month. I tested lactate after the last rep and it was at 3:47 min/km pace with an average heart rate of and a maximum heart rate of . Workout #2 took place in March 2024, after an extended break from running (4 weeks off in February, only biking on a smart trainer and strength training). Again, I tested lactate after the last rep and this time I got at 3:48 min/km pace, despite having an average heart rate of and a maximum heart rate of . These two workouts were in almost identical conditions (24.3 vs 23.4 Celsius, 44.5% vs 47% RH, respectively). The only difference is that the treadmill was set to an incline of 0.5% during workout #2. The difference between the two lactate readings is quiet significant. If I had chosen to train by a pre-set HR target on the first workout, I would have probably ended up running too hard/fast. I have other examples on how much the lactate/HR can drift apart under constant HR, but for simplicity and repeatability, I only showcased the 6 x 1K treadmill workout. I made the same observation for outdoor workouts. In this ( ) experiment of comparing lactate with heart rate, my experience suggests that there exists a HR/lactate decoupling effect, where the two can be significantly uncorrelated. As it stands though, training by a set heart rate inferred from a certain protocol might not be suitable in certain conditions ( ). Values obtained from the treadmill do not always transfer well into the outdoor realm as well. One must take into account all these variables and control for them for a meaningful target. If the desired outcome in a threshold workout is a specific lactate value, there is no going around the fact that a lactate meter is the way to go. Lactate values can be skewed to multiple reasons, including nutrition. More testing over a longer period will give a better insight about the behavior of the different subset models. I took over a 100 lactate samples over the past year in different settings and compared them to HR. The relationship between HR and lactate is to establish a set target HR for training the training is lactated-based (i.e., the goal is to hit a specific lactate value).",

For me, most of my workouts are early AM, but I notice if I change to later in the day my HR ends up much higher for the same RPE. Similarly how much fatigue im carrying pulls my HR down. If I am really spent after maybe going a bit too hard earlier in the week, or a bigger workout, I will notice trouble getting up to the same HR. I tried to force it for a bit, but it became obvious the lactate threshold is more inline with your feeling than your heart rate, which generally corellates much better with PACE then HR. So now I just work paces, occasionally check in with how I'm feeling, and basically ignore HR within the context of the workout itself. It is fun to compare it across workouts later, though.",

    "message": "Can't praise you enough for sharing your data Jiggy. I think that completely backs up the original guide sirpoc put up. This is incredibly helpful for those who are weighing up the option of going pace or HR when a meter is not possible. Sirpoc originally said, lactate testing is best which is quite the obvious answer, but pace is a better indication than HR. I was skeptical of this, but I have come absolutely full circle to 100% agree with rgis. The advantage of pace being that you can run the same route each week. If it's flat, even better. Even better still, run on a track. I suspect pace, as sirpoc posted a long time back, will not always work , but it'll get you where you want to be of the time, or at least closer than going by HR will. His unbelievable progression, with you confirming now he hasn't used lactate testing for a while, is testament to that pace is almost certainly the clear winner if it's a straight choice between pace or HR. Of course lactate testing is best, but it is certainly not practical for everyone. Especially if you run outside and not on a track. I don't think this thread has all the answers, or that any of the main contributers would say they do, but it likely provides the average/above talented runner the absolute best opportunity to reach their potential , or as close to it as you can get, with the least risk. I've been training like this since October now and have made a big jump from mid 18s in the last 5 seasons to a low 17 in the start of the summer 5k races. I'm 44 so I couldn't be happier as I just assumed the chance to ever break 18 was gone a few years ago. I've been trying to get a couple of my local clubs teammates to adopt this training, but their old skool mentality just can't bring them to. Which is a shame, we could do with the extra points and we might even win this year's team series! However, the thought of no 5k pace work has them baulking at the postposition. Yet my 1+ minute PB they can't seem to correlate I wouldn't have probably got, had I not adopted this method. I think we runners we are so engrained and can't help ourselves and we must do interval or speed based work. I hope this thread goes on and on. It's undoubtedly the most useful thread I've ever come across on letsrun and I've been here a while, as well as being the least toxic. Happy running everyone!",

    "message": "Sorry, but I don't understand what you have done and the examples being provided your workout 2 shows that you have a higher HR corresponding to a higher Lactate reading compared to workout 1... so it works ? I think it is pretty established that a lactate curve compared to intensity is exponential shaped, whereas a HR curve has a more linear shape. so yes a 1 BPM variation can lead to a very high lactate reading difference, especially around the threshold ? Isn't it the whole concept of threshold?? so yeah I mean if you want your training to be what you call \"lactate based\" HR will of course be a different indicator but why on earth would you want your training to be lactate based at this level of performance ? I thought this was a thread for time-crunched hobby joggers. if you want to hit sub-threshold you just have to be careful around not hitting too close to your threshold heart rate if you just use pace, it is guaranteed on a windy or hot day if you have preexisiting fatigue you will overshoot the threshold but tbh that is fine too so I wouldn't be 100% set on hitting a prescribed pace, you can be flexible around it. of course the best is keep doing what works for you so adding lactate reading can probably improve your precision around the threshold. I just don't think this is where the performance improvement lies for people's level of performance right now.",

    "message": "I'll assume this was a reply to my post earlier. Pretty straightforward, determine how much lactate and a certain average heart rate are correlated. Yes, but this analysis was not accounting for intensity, just lactate vs average heart rate. The exponential curve you talk about is a different topic. Also, no, that small change in heart rate should not result in that big of a change in lactate. 1.6 mmol/L differential within few BPM is not normal, especially when it is clearly a sub threshold effort. I have an another example for you: Workout A = 5 x 1.6 k and workout B = 6 x 1.6 k) on the same route. Workout A took place on the 14th of June with in 37.2 C & 48% RH (feels-like 44.4 deg C). Workout B took place on the 4th of October in 32.2 C & 67% RH (feels-like 39.4 deg C). While the weather was not so much better in the second workout, I still think it provides some value. In workout A, I tested for lactate after all reps except the third, which is exactly the opposite in the workout B, where I only tested lactate after the third. The second rep that workout A was @ 4:30/km average with HR of 171 and Max of 177, lactate = 2.2 mmol/L Fourth rep that day was @ 4:27/km with HR of 183 and Max of 188, lactate = 3.1 mmol/L Whereas in workout B the third rep was @ 3:57/km average with HR of 170 and Max 176, lactate = 3.6 mmol/L Just in case anyone has trouble following this wall of text, here's table format to summarize the difference: 171 4:30/km 2.2 170 3:57/km 3.1 So you can see, despite running at a higher HR in workout A, lactate was lower due to the slower paces. LTHR is a good approximation, but you could under/over shoot when running by it, especially so in challenging conditions. You could approach and be at LTHR, but a lactate test would reveal that you're still not at threshold. Conversely, you could run too fast in good conditions at LTHR, and end up with a higher lactate level than desired. Well, even time-crunched runners have a 60 second window for a lactate test ;) To each their own, I would never argue that any of this is necessary for improving performance, but understanding what works is definitely beneficial for efficient training.",

He's still progressing in a nice way despite running never close to race pace. The thing to remember here is really only lactate/ load is what matters. We are just using pace, as a simplifier to try to get close to the lactate we want. We are really lucky to have this thread and all the free information that sirpoc and others provide.

A lot of people are underdeveloped enough aerobically that they can still make incredible progress with easier-to-execute workouts in the more familiar threshold to sub-threshold effort range, so it's just not yet worth the skill development effort and risk of overreaching to take on the more difficult to execute workout.

Firstly I think the 400m efforts should 100% be done on the treadmill. You don't have to control pace and once you have done it once or twice you know exactly what you need to aim for. You can then progress it gradually as your other workouts get easier. Secondly, the 400m efforts are a totally different stimulus to the 3min, 6 min and 12 min efforts. If you're doing only 3 thresholds a week then it would make a lot more sense to cut out the 400s because it's highly likely to be the session where you spend the least time at the beneficial threshold zone you are targeting. Whereas if you are doubling and then do an easier session on the Saturday, you have slightly more time to add this workout in. I do it as a Tuesday PM workout after 5 x 6 mins in the morning.",

My guess is that you could aim for shorter reps (5x6min or 10x3 min on Tues, 25x60s on Thursdays), then do the usual hill session (10x30s if working into shape, then build up to 2x10x30s if it's not too much) that the Norwegians do on Saturdays, with two days easy afterward. The hills are intense but easier on the joints than track sessions. Muscular power and anaerobic capacity become more important to train here if races are shorter, but I think implementing threshold sessions is still helpful for raising aerobic capacity.

Unfortunately, most hobby joggers tend to fall into the 5k through Marathon range. This approach for what my 2 cents is worth, is likely the best way I've ever seen for someone on 5-9 hours a week. Even if you just use the pace guide , which might need shifting around a little bit as per individual due to being at different aerobic stages ....it's well within what's reasonable for most people who have some aerobic background to just plug and play. Now, 800 is so specific and I have coached quite a few people here..... that I think you have to probably accept that if you are an 800/1500 guy, I wouldn't train like this. If you are a 1500/5k guy, absolutely I would almost not change anything other than some hills maybe every second or third week outside of the race season. The 800 though is just so specific , it's probably the most fun when you get it right, but the hardest to get to that point. I really don't think this is THE thread for 800 guys, there's better and more important stuff to focus on. But even the 1500 is so aerobic, someone who has capacity to improve and pull their aerobic growth from below, I'd be surprised if they didn't improve with sticking to the spirit and fundamentals of this approach.",

Giving oneself a small periodization phase prior to an upcoming mid-distance race where there is a focus on speed is a well-documented practice in sports science literature. There's no reason why it can't be done for hobby joggers, it's not that hard to implement. The 200/300/400 reps should be run at race pace, so they're not being run all out. Just like people are slightly modifying sirpoc's training for marathon training by including a few longer LR sessions, you can slightly modify it ~6 weeks before an upcoming race like the 1500 by replacing some of the sub-T sessions with race-pace 200s/300s/400s.

On hobby joggers 5-9 hours a week schedule you’ll have to use threshold to max out CTL. If spiroc had consistently more or less time, his training would be different.",

    "message": "I don't have a huge amount of data for running, all I know for me (so far) is I can plot CTL / 5k performance reasonably neatly. So far, more is more. I suspect, there's a cut off with this. In terms of you max out your aerobic capacity and you can probably get by with less CTL, for the same performance and add in hills, speed work. I'm not there yet, I don't think. My guess, as would be with cyclists on time crunched (mainly being top amateur/ sub elite time trialists in the UK) that you probably won't reach the point where this is a huge factor. I'm talking 9 hours a week or less. 8 hours is the point in which I've got in my head I might have reached diminished aerobic returns and have to try something else to add in. But time will tell. A guy way smarter than me on the old TT forums, did his own study of a number of people's training and how the acquired CTL matches with performance. The general jist was, the difference in FTP at a given CTL for each individual, was probably +-10% spread, if you consider what is the absolute worst training schedule you could do (my z2 for weeks and weeks and hours and hours on end) versus the best bang for buck, being sweet spot. Basic example , CTL of 60. A sensible, generic training plan might generate a FTP of 300. The worst training you could do, just aimlessly riding, but generating the same CTL, might get you can FTP of 270 (note it would take you way longer in time to also reach the same CTL) . A really well thought out, sweetspot block of 6 months might scrape out 330w ( in much less time riding). All for the same CTL of 60. That's the extreme end. For me, I was a much narrower range , where X CTL basically equalled Y power from a baseline of about 160-70w untrained and a CTL of 0. The guy I talked to a lot about this was a swimming coach, he found it also applied to swimmers he'd known and triathlon specialists. To me, something along these lines makes perfect sense for running, albeit with some small running specific factors etc, mainly the ability to absorb pretty big punishment on the body. But in a nutshell, it's roughly what I've stuck to, followed the plan, the numbers and I'm still seeing the improvements I'm happy with and would expect to see. Incidentally , again, this would need bigger studies, there are two people who messaged me direct on Strava (I think one has posted in this thread) who have adapted this to do marathon pace work , so right at the bottom of the sub threshold range and they have racked up huge CTL numbers in 6 + months and without even really thinking about it. One set a 5k PB and one set a 10k PB. Sadly, neither had accurate historical data from years past, but the main takeaway was from talking to them, that almost certainly in terms of overall load, they were both just doing much more than they ever had, but just in a controlled manner/ racking up the training load. Much like I was shocked when I suddenly hit a power pb after a big crash and just riding the turbo aimlessly to keep myself busy. I stand by that nearly a year on, it's probably likely to make most people improve, but as we have seen with some cases in the Strava group, it's very easy to get it wrong and come unstuck like other training modes, if you go too hard. Ultimately, most of us here are hampered by our aerobic capacity. Training like this is pushing it up from below, even at what seems like pretty easy running levels.",

I am one of the guys you were speaking of! got fully confused and obsessed in what I would call quite aggressive marathon plans!! By race day I was usually absolutely spent. My longest run this time a couple of weeks out was 30k easy. It's the slowest pace and shortest distance I've done as my big last run and I've ran 7 Ms now. Even with the long run I made sure my sub threshold didn't take a bit of backseat. I felt super strong even past 30k to go on race day. I assumed I would hit the wall at some point, it basically never came. To add, my build didn't feel anything special until around 12 weeks in and I knew this time would be different. I have never felt fresh in a marathon plan at 3 months before. All I changed as you know was the long run was longer on a Sunday @usually 110-120 mijs and the Thursday session was longer at 5x9 mins , at M pace . Other two sub threshold were a mixture of the ones you have been doing. Standard 10*1k up to 3*3k. I had no intention of going for a 5k. But happened as happy accident. My guess now with my new found understanding, in the past for 5k I was totally obsessed with speed!!! Speed , speed , speed and more speed workouts. When actually, I was just embarrassingly under developed in an aerobic sense. M was a PB hugely and a 45 second 5k PB as well. Two for the price of one!! I see others have been asking about the M. I wouldn't change much. What I did worked well think and it easily replicated.",

    "message": "I hope you recover fast and keep us posted! Saw a related article from RW UK. Unlike the American RW, it's more technical and delves into definitions of tempo/threshold/sub-threshold: Terminology in running can be confusing. If you're wondering about the differences between threshold and tempo running, I'm afraid I can't give a straight answer. For some runner and coaches, tempo running refers to longer efforts at a slightly lower intensity, which you might be able to hold for two to three hours in a race (closer to lactate threshold). For others, it's a run at a pace slightly stronger than lactate turnpoint, closer to 30 to 40-minute race pace, while some use tempo running and threshold running interchangeably. Sometimes, it's better to just say what you mean: for example, run for a pace you could hold for 40 to 60 minutes in a race, run at this heart rate, etc. Or can you make it even simpler – easy, steady, strong, hard, for example. There are a few good workouts that are somewhat similar to those posted here: If you’re just starting out or racing over shorter distances (1500m to 5K), then 15 to 25 minutes at this effort is enough. For half-marathon or marathon training, consider building to 30 to 50 minutes of effort as you get closer to race day. Warm up well and include 15 to 25 mins of running at threshold effort before cooling down. : When you’re in top condition, add a 30 to 60-sec surge up to 5 to 10K pace every five minutes to improve your ability to buffer lactate. Start easy and build gradually to include a block of threshold running towards the latter stages of a continuous run. For example, 15 mins easy, 15 steady and 15 at threshold effort. : Pick a flat or rolling route and run out for 22 mins, building to a steady effort. Run the same route back, aiming to finish in 40 mins. Splitting threshold sessions into long efforts with short, easy or steady recoveries can allow you to extend the amount of time you spend at threshold effort, or run slightly quicker while keeping your intensity under control. For example, 6 x 5 mins with 60-sec easy recoveries, or 3 x 10-15 mins with 2-min easy-to-steady recoveries. : Split sessions allow you to vary your paces. Try 12 mins, 10 mins, 8 mins and 4 mins, with 90-sec recoveries. Start at a pace you could hold for 60 to 70 mins in a race and work down to 30 to 45-min race pace.",

I think his skill is applying what works and keeping it simple. That's just my view anyway. There are definitely more scientific minds that can un-pick potentially what is working and why and let's leave sirpoc in peace to train, improve and keep things relatively simple for those who are interested in training like this. One thing none of us can argue with, is a thread full of so many success stories over a decent amount of time? That makes this relatively unique as a topic. Maybe why we are all so interest?. There is a potential for an absolute huge study to come off the back off this thread, but it's very important to keep in mind that this method or training still is niche and the long term it needs top produce results, isn't great for intervention studies. I think there could be a good bit drilled down into the hows and whys of all this and some real good science could come of it, but I don't think lexel for instance constantly spamming the thread with CV. Even when he has a point, he loses the point. What has me very curious is what sirpoc mentioned also from training load, performance and how that load is acquired. I think the 10% spread mentioned from the best and worst training loads applies to running and would explain some studies or cases I've seen. In which guys just do lots of running, way more than normal for say an ultra or such, then PB at all distances. In theory it's terrible training but shear volume even though it's bad outweighs a more robust and time efficient system. We have probably all heard of stories like this over years.",

    "message": "I would say that Spiroc doesn't come from primarily a physiological perspective, not that he isn't scientifically oriented. He certainly has experience making hypothesis and testing the results and in that way he is scientifically oriented. This is what I was trying to get at in the above post about CTL and TSS. It's a very different approach to training than most runners (myself included!) are accustomed to. That's also why it's so fascinating. It's different and it works. As runners we've been conditioned to think primarily physiologically. Any training argument that Jack Daniels, Steve Magness, or Pete Pfitzinger makes, for example, is primarily about physiology and NOT load accumulation. When Spiroc is comparing 3 sub threshold a week to a Jack Daniels plan, his argument isn't about vLT, VO2 max, Aerobic threshold, economy or anything physiologically oriented. It's basically that a JD plan beats you up too much for a lower load. In the long term you can accumulate more load more consistently with 3 sub threshold runs. If you're trying to PR in 8 weeks, a JD plan will probably be better. But in 8 months, the argument goes, 3 sub threshold is way better because you create much more load and you can do it over and over again (more on that later). That doesn't mean Spiroc isn't scientifically minded, it just means he's thinking about it from a different angle. This is much more natural for cyclists because power is such a reliable metric. This is another reason why pace based TSS is important. Although it isn't perfect, at least it's load measure that's relative to performance, where as heart rate based TSS (physiologically oriented) is an indirect measure that will have much less correlation to performance. Spiroc and cyclists in this camp seem to be thinking more in terms of work in, work out, numbers in numbers out, not \"what physiological system am I working on.\" Do more work, smarter, and you get better. In this approach, there isn't a lot of the other stuff we commonly see in programs: taxing long runs, up weeks and down weeks, peaking, large tapers, strides, race pace focus, periodization etc. The reasoning why this program doesn't include those basically boils down to how much load those methods create, in how much time, requiring how much recovery. This doesn't mean that physiology isn't important! I would be very interested in all of the tests mentioned above to see what's happening 'under the hood' with this approach. This approach uses physiology to control training intensity. Rather than use physiology as a tool to discern what workout uses what physiological system, this approach just uses it to ensure we're not overdoing it. Easy runs at <70% HR Max and Sub T under 4. mm (generalizing here) is more about the recovery needed than the stimulus provided. Threshold runs at 4.2 will provide negligible load compared to 3.8. But over weeks and weeks of tipping over the threshold, fatigue accumulates and it's no longer sustainable. The lactate testing and easy runs are about ensuring there is a positive load to recovery needed ratio. Stay on the positive side of that for a while and the fitness will come.",

It was a big mental shift for me, and my RPE was completely skewed because I was severely overtrained in college – hard 8k race pace intervals from 5:00 to 5:10 pace regularly with long tempos at 5:25-5:30 pace. I stagnated at around 26:00s for 8k and 15:10s for 5k, thinking I couldn't train hard enough. Since I was going hard so frequently, I think my body was anaerobically overtrained. I could get from hard interval to interval just fine (thinking that being able to finish was about 18 RPE), but sustained paces were much more challenging. As it turns out, I was a \"Theo Quax\" case. I got my lactate threshold tested in laboratory at the university, and I guess my true threshold corresponded to 5:50-6:00 pace, much slower than my previous workout paces. It also seems astonishingly low for a 15:10 guy, but that is where I started and am getting near 14:50s now after trying this method, recalibrating my own RPE, and literally crawling at 5:55-6:00 for a while (now more comfortable at 5:40-5:50). I do think my body benefited from previously having high muscular strength from quick intervals, but interesting that I am improving after slowing down my workouts so much (and that my threshold range is so slow for my PRs – slower than Kristoffer Ingebrigtsen despite having faster PRs!). Anyway, just thought I'd share how variable thresholds can be, with some outliers like Theo and myself needing to slow down more than most to find improvement. I don't fully get it either since I'm no scientist, but it was a hard lesson for me to learn and glad I didn't discount this approach to training.",

I'm at about 7:30-8:00 min/mile pace now, but started off much slower at around 9 min pace just to achieve <70% MHR, which for me means 130-140 bpm. I used to foolishly hover around 165-170 bpm for easy runs around 6:30 pace in college – way too fast, but our coach wanted us to be \"serious college athletes\" and \"train hard and steady\". I think training like that really stunted my aerobic development, since it's taken nearly 6 months just for my truly easy runs to not feel like walking. Really had to ditch the ego for both easy runs and threshold workouts. In case this is helpful, I mostly started with 3x10min (Tues), 5x6min (Thurs), 25x1min (Sat), then upped the volume a bit for the Tues/Thurs sessions (so 3x12min and 5x8min) after 4 months since I'm a bit higher mileage (70ish mpw, not quite enough to justify double threshold). Every 2-3 weeks I'll still toss in a hard VO2 interval session in there (or do hill repeats) just to \"feel fast\" (part of it was me trying to prove whether this training method was working for me) or replace a race effort, and I feel very strong at those paces still. I does take a bit longer to \"feel\" recovered from them than before, but maybe that's just because I'm finally giving my body a chance to repair now instead of hopping back to 6:30 pace the the next couple days. Anyway, I probably have some of the slowest workouts of any 14:50 guy, but somehow it's not working against me.",

As CHillruns in his amazing post point out, its the planned and controlled nature that allows this volume to be expressed over a long period of time. Whereas, of course if you run 5k pace in workouts , your legs won't fall off, but cumulatively you won't be able to run as much. The 5k pace work is undone by need for days off , really easy days or down weeks. I think CHillruns posts recently have really helped provide outside context. I wasn't aware sirpoc TT regularly. I thought he just raced? Maybe seems to be once every 4-6 weeks or so at this point. Maybe even less. Maybe I have that wrong? But I do agree entirely with the cost benefit to older runners.",

Like potentially adding on 200m repeats at mile pace after a threshold workout? For background, I am 29 years old and started using Jack Daniel’s 1500m training plan in November. I followed it all the way through indoor and outdoor until I finished it last week. I was able to drop my mile personal best from 4:51.85 to 4:40.85 doing that training, but my mile PR was from March and I didn’t improve anymore in the final six weeks. During phase three of Daniel’s program, I was doing one VO2 max workout a week along with mile pace repetitions. I felt super burnt out during that portion of the training, and I didn’t run any faster over the final six weeks of the program. Maybe I was training a little too hard?

The reason is, this system works on lactic acid utilization and if you stagnate, it probably means you need to teach your body to produce more lactic acid, so that you have more \"fuel\". Most people accomplish this by either strides, \"150s\" or (like you said) mile pace 200s. I think 400-800 pace 200s with longer rest is better for this purpose because you'll produce more lactic acid. This is also the \"last 5%\" type of thing, your stagnation is from focusing on this 5% rather than the 95% that is threshold training, which means you probably have a lot more potential than you think, just look at sirpoc dropping MINUTES off his 5k (big relationship to the mile) not even including that faster work.",

Used to race my bike so I had a fair understanding of the principles in this thread and was very pleased to see someone use a forumulatic approach to running as is normal in cycling. For remarks. I was 19:20 for the 5k. I had been running roughly 2 years. I follow a few different plans, they usually result in the sense issue. Breakdown, injury, just after running somewhere in 19. I reset in September my training to this. I would say until Santa Claus came, nothing and I was very disappointed. I felt strong on intervals, but not doing fast work felt silly, slow and honestly I almost throw this in the trash and come here to say how silly this is. But then a remarkable happened, I just decided to set off on a 5k solo TT at my local track here in the province. I thought I would set myself to pace around 19 flat, right from start. I expected to fail. But I didn't. I never had feel so strong a feeling and whilst my legs maybe didn't have training at that speed, my aerobic was so strong and I could just hold the pace I set out at. I even managed to kick at last lap and finish solo TT in 18:48. I couldn't believe. Now more months on. I just broke 18 for 17:56 in my local race now weather is better. I never thought much like this was possible, at years of 37. I just want to thank Strava group, here and sirpoc for everything he shared and how he helps if asked . If I ever in UK, we know this man likes beer I will buy him one! Also how it inspiring to see someone just struggle like the rest of us now run times at 40+ years that are in stratosphere. Maybe trolls are here too, but I think this thread bring out the true spirit of community amateur running. If you take anything from my post on the internet, please give this way a chance. But don't expect miracle. It does not work in an instant but you can maybe do things you didn't know you can do.

I haven't done any hill reps and dropped the 300m reps in the spring once I started doing more club workouts and races. It has been less intense than any previous attempt to run a fast 1500m. Certainly nothing like the traditional 8x400 @ mile pace with 60s recoveries type workout. I just took a couple of seconds off my high-school 1500m PB (I'm in my mid-30s now). Other than this season the quickest I've run in the past 5 years was 10s slower. Still only running 4:16 so quite firmly in hobby jogger land but the training definitely works. I got outsprinted in the final 100m, but I finished quicker than I've ever done before so it doesn't really matter. Maybe you need Martin & Coe-style middle-distance training to win big races.

    "message": "Chill Runs, very thoughtful post! This is the type of discussion I’ve been waiting for since TSS was first brought up! As far as I can tell, in trying to discern how Andrew Coggan derived TSS, it seems he used the percent of 60 minute race pace (which he called FTP or Jack Daniels would call T-pace) and the percent of the lactate value at that pace (based on using a power function to model the lactate curve) to assign stress points. Then scaled it so that the score for a 60 minute race effort would be equivalent to 100 TSS. Sirpoc shared with me some old cycling threads Coggan posted in and he himself states that TSS is not a system meant to represent physiological stress, strictly training stress. I share all that only to set up this next point. As I interpret your post and the general validation for using TSS from others, it seems to reduce to maximizing training load, so CTL. That long-term training stress is thus dependent on the TSS equation. So, with that in mind, consider this. A score of 60 TSS can be achieved in many ways, three of which are 55 minutes at 80% FTP, 36 minutes at 100% FTP, and 30 minutes at 110% FTP. To put that in terms of Jack Daniels 80% FTP is E-pace, 100% FTP is T-pace, and 110% FTP is I-pace. So, according to the TSS equation, those three workouts would be equivalent in stress. Now, I don’t expect strike zone accuracy, but being in the ball park seems a reasonable expectation. Does any runner think those are even close? If I made it to 30 minutes at I-pace, I’ll have also made it to heaven, because I’d be dead haha. Contrast that with 55 minutes at E-pace (which I think many feel is more like a moderate pace). That’s something I could do regularly, particularly if I’m not doing any workouts. To be fair, and I do try, Coggan designed this system based on training by power for cyclists, so there is that consideration. However, if the underlying equation which is quantifying training stress is so skewed, how seriously should it be treated in an attempt to generalize an explanation on? I think the poster lactate_guided pointed this out… TSS, while directionally accurate, is likely not a predictor of race performance nor physiologically accurate. Another way to possibly frame this, if training load, as determined by TSS, is the driver of fitness, one should be able to achieve the same race results on the same CTL score, no matter the intensity distribution. I imagine that if most people took their weekly average intensity, it would fall between 75-80% FTP? That’s probably a little slower than Daniels E-pace for most. If you simply ran that pace, for the same amount of hours per week, do you think your race results would be the same? I think the workouts matter, but so too does the individual and their physiological make-up. Another observation, and this may just be that many on this thread are from a cycling background and/or are new to running? There seems to be this suggestion that runners have no concept of training load or haven’t thought of this type of approach/mindset before? I can think of several examples just on LRC, going back to the early 2000’s, that would suggest that assessment to be unfair. Tinman started a thread, “no interval work success” where the whole discussion basically promoted and shared experiences of runners training exclusively in the easy to threshold pace range. John Kellogg practically wrote a book, “The Training Wisdom of John Kellogg”, which a poster compiled somewhere, on how he coached Wejo to a massive 10km pr of 28:06 doing almost exclusively base work (i.e. volume and threshold). Hadd, whose original thread may be longer than this one (?), outlined what is essentially this method, but based on HR instead of lactate. And though it wasn’t on this site, to show that Andrew Coggan isn’t the only PhD with a training stress point system, Jack Daniels published his own point system for tracking training stress in his second edition. Which, bringing it back to LRC, a user programmed into an Excel workbook at the time and shared on this site (jiggymeister, you may want to look for that version haha). There are even more flamboyant (though likely unknown) coaches like Lyle Knudson who’ve promoted near daily threshold running (sorry sirpoc and shirtboy, the experiment has already been run, literally haha). Lastly, sirpoc leading on that he’s not scientific is a bigger troll job than JS Wizard ever leveled on this thread haha. He’s far more keen minded than he credits himself as.",

That's been the bulk of the work since last August. Mile reps have come down from 6:10-ish to 5:50 over that time at the same effort. Looking at my training log for the past four weeks, in this period I've done about 12k at quicker than 10k pace, half of which came from racing. Two 1500m races, a 3k race, the second half of one workout (5k pace down to 1500m pace), one full workout (1500-3k pace) and a handful of long strides at the end of another workout (1500m pace). So the amount of faster running hasn't been trivial but it's only really been the past 6-8 weeks like this, and the bulk of quick mileage has still been threshold stuff. Compared to the last time I was in something like this shape I reckon I'm doing 75% less mileage at quicker than 10k pace and at least double the total volume of 'fast' running (most being at threshold pace).",

    "message": "One thing I will add as a remark about TSS and Coggan. It's been around for many years and nobody has improved it yet. Maybe this is the thread to do the work?! I will add. I agree with a lot you say Hard2find but I also fully agree with sirpoc . He has hit the nail on the head about what a lot of cyclists and triathlon guys already know, the difference in performance between the best way to train and gain CTL vs the worst, will result in not really as much a spread of power / fitness than you would think. The makeup of TSS does matter, but definitely not as much as people have suspected. Two things seemed to be the case when I was chatting on slow twitch years ago. 1. People who trained via sweetspot like this method does for running , could gain CTL the quickest, stay freshest and CTL and performance was linear 2. The people who did huge volume for something like an ultra IM, but a lot of it was easy, still were reporting they got around the same power gains at the same CTL despite doing nothing as hard. It just took longer to get to the same CTL . It was maybe as sirpoc reported, maybe 5% less power . So again this shows there is a best or worst way to train, but margin or error is narrow. This system laid out by sirpoc just happen to be the system that maybe seems to gain CTL the easiest way, stay fresh but also the most efficient. I don't think actually this is the best way to train. If plausible for example you can get 70 CTL via Daniel's and 70 CTL by sirpoc method, Daniel's might be better, at top end of spectrum of that 10% margin of effort for CTL Vs performance. But point being, take that random CTL number I use example, you probably can't get to 70 CTL by Daniel's method, break down, too tired, body won't allow but you could or can via sirpoc method. CTL and TSS not perfect but I think it can provide us some good guide here. What needs happening is someone produce a system like Coggan but we agree on how to apply it broadly to running.

    "message": "You guys are fishing in the darkness. The training method described here by sirpoc, improves mainly . I.e. one theory is that fast twitch fibers (type IIa) will get more aerobically and therefore more efficient during training. Easy paces need mainly slow twitch fibers and higher paces require more and more fast twitch fibers (additional to slow twitch fibers). That further leads to the theory that more time spend around LT2 (sub-CV), recruits type IIa fast twitch fibers for a longer duration and that leads to the improvement in CR (cost of running). Total time spend around LT2, consistent over some period, seems to be important. TSS/CTL is not a good index for that and in general (agree with H2find), and can be easily falsified. I am sure brain learning is involved too, as the brain fires and adresses the fibers. Also here, more time spend around LT2 means more learning time for the brain.",

    "message": "I think it's a bit of a misnomer to look at this as mainly a cost of running (O2 consumption at a certain speed) matter when it's also (arguably more) about increasing the budget we have to spend. Running a lot at around threshold effort pushes up LT1 and LT2 so we can run relatively faster within a sustainable effort. It's the ability to sustain a higher % of max O2 consumption and thus run faster at sustainable speeds. Running economy involves a bunch of different factors that contribute in different ways (musculoskeletal, neuromuscular, bioenergetic, etc). The aerobic training of fast/intermediate fiber types looks like an issue of efficiency when looking at all these factors collectively, but in large part that efficiency is achieved by improving the bioenergetic capacity of these fibers -a bigger budget to spend so we spend more (run faster) without going bioenergetically bankrupt. While I'm not a fan of TSS/CTL as the leading/only metric of training load in running (and I don't use it currently myself), I think it makes sense within in the context in which it's being used here. It's being used for the optimization of training within relatively narrow parameters already set by common sense. If we are primarily addressing an issue of bioenergetic capacity the optimal solution is likely going to be just throwing as much training load at is as we can sustain. The ways in which TSS/CTL could really be \"falsified\" are outside of the common sense bounds we've already set so it's not a huge concern.",

The mods should keep the craziness in here in my opinion. Adds to it all! I pretty much agree with what you are saying. Training like this as sirpoc has laid out, I suspect CTL pace based metric is a fantastic tool. It's a narrow range and in my experience sweetspot is predicted very, very well by Coggan's original formula when it comes to power. I suspect more is more, until it's not. The higher you can get your CTL training like this method laid out, you'll almost certainly be faster. I also broadly agree with sirpoc and other posters, the difference between training systems and CTL reached per individual, is not that large. I've seen other cases in cycling especially like sirpoc where you can predict what power will be at a certain CTL, almost no matter what makeup of training is. Many grand tours are planned like this for pro cyclists, in a broad simplistic term. Very, very interesting debate. Not something I ever thought I would engage with on a place like LRC!",

    "message": "Yeah I think the whole CTL thing in this case basically comes down to that we're dealing with runners who are mainly limited by bioenergetics, have a training framework that is sensible independent of CTL, and then use CTL to optimize that framework so that we are throwing as much training load at the bioenergetic limitation as possible. Obviously, there are still other aspects to training, and there's cases where the utility of CTL would start to break down (events shorter than 5k, athletes nearing their true limit of training and ability, etc). For a lot people some basic attention to stuff like strides, short hill sprints, and plyometrics is probably enough to pretty well handle the non-bioenergetic aspects of training that aren't reflected in CTL. Maybe a CTL/TSS concept could be refined by using an athlete's power curve instead of just FTP to calculate TSS. I'm not super clear on the math off the top of my head. I'd also still be cautious about using CTL or similar metrics as predictive of running performance in the same way as cycling. In cycling the bike handles a lot of aspects of biomechanical \"technique\" and it is not a plyometric exercise like running, so a generalized measure of training that reasonably captures bioenergetic fitness will correlate well with performance. With running our biomechanics at different paces and various musculoskeletal characteristics will create a lot of variance in how well our general bioenergetic fitness translates to actual performance, so CTL is likely less predictive.",

    "message": "@ Blue Meenie and John Whelan Those were both thoughtful additions with what you added about TSS/CTL. I tried to steer away from analyzing sirpoc’s training (update: it’s clearly working for him) or redrafting the blueprint for implementing it, and it seems you’re both thinking in that direction too, refreshing! I’d agree that if you run the experiment where the control is just running easy and the alternative adds in 2-3 quality days, for the same number of hours per week, there would be around a 5% improvement in performance within 6-12 weeks. That would actually reflect my personal experience too. However, what specifically you do (tempo intervals vs continuous tempos vs fartlek), I think, is more a function of what you respond to, both physiologically and psychologically. So that’s where I was going when I said workouts matter but so too does the individual. Regarding the accuracy of TSS… there are very simple modifications you could make so that the formula is more accurate for runners, particularly for the range of paces that most people run their workouts. Again, if on the faster end, a score of, say, 90 isn’t even achievable because the duration required at the pace is not physically possible, but on the slower end it can be achieved with an easy to moderately paced longer run, that skews any analysis being done. I still think the system is useful though. Similar to how Jack Daniels uses a standardized running economy curve for VDOT, you could do the same with a lactate curve for assigning a stress score. A simple exponential, in my opinion, makes for a much improved equivalency across the pace spectrum of say 70% to 120% FTP. However, CTL is responsible for tracking the long term training load, and that seems to be the focus of this discussion. It doesn’t surprise me that one notices a fairly accurate linear relationship between their race performance and CTL (particularly when you train as consistently as sirpoc has). You can take ANY positively sloped function though, from linear, polynomial, power, or exponential to represent your stress score. When you run it through an exponentially weighted filter, which CTL is, you end up with the same shaped function. A positively increasing, but at a decaying rate, improvement curve over time. Add additional stimulus to your training and you’ll accrue more CTL. So, yes, it can be used as a predictor (time to update the calculator haha), but consider the accuracy of the input. I imagine the TSS/CTL approach is popular in the cycling community, because it’s simple and accurate enough. There are plenty of alternative models that exist and which are specifically meant to be performance predictors though. In fact, Andrew Coggan created TSS/CTL by simplifying a more nuanced performance prediction model (Banister Impulse -Response Model).",

Anyway, I am slowly reintroducing running. back into the schedule, but I feel like my fitness is about the same, if not somewhat improved, since when I got injured. Before I got injured I had signed up for a race on the first week of June, so that performance will be the real test to gauge my fitness level. If you are injury-prone (like me) or an older individual, it may be worth it to try to do one subT session per week via arc trainer/elliptical/bike and see if that may be more sustainable for you.

I think sirpoc laid out well a while back why this works over say a Daniel's plan. It's accumulation of load over a long period of time without need for rest. One session a week in my humble opinion there is much better ways to train than this. As I said above, in my opinion this is also the best way to train, but if hou vary too much from sirpoc guide, you will start to stray into territory of changing things where it's not needed.",

Part of the problem here for running TSS/CTL is that most implementations (Runalyze, Intervals.icu, Garmin) default to using versions of heart rate based TRIMP. TRIMP (even trimp_exp) is an awful load measure because it's based on heart rate (which is a response to load, not load itself) and also way overweights very low intensity while not even being able to measure true high intensity (again, heart rate). Power in cycling doesn't have these issues. Honestly, this could be half the reason people like me have seen such drastic differences in fitness even at the same CTL. Another good outcome of this thread would be acknowledging our current tools for load management suck and that's holding back the running community from becoming more precise with our training (incl sub-threshold training).",

I also agree power solves most if not all the problems to someone who is looking to get 99% of their potential. But , unfortunately, the Stryd sucks for me, as I've posted. I've sent Hard2find on a mission before to try work it out. But his conclusion, it also just won't work for me. I don't fit the algorithm when wind comes into play. That also basically sums up your last point, there's no perfect system as of yet, which is likely holding things back. There also doesn't seem to be as many people training like this, for a group of us to share and compare data like I have seen done on TT forum etc in the past. I did share my last two years 5k time versus CTL graph with Hard2find this morning, based on pace. But I have no idea how to link pictures here. Having said all that, I still stand by my initial guide. That if you don't get even mixed up and involved in the metrics etc and just run 3x sub threshold a week by following roughly the paces ( the spreadsheet someone made on Strava is excellent) given, most people will improve over say a year. I haven't actually been keeping track, but I think most people who have reported back who have trained like this have improved?

I started with 10x200m @ 5min 1k pace on a dirt road every other day (I dont do long runs just thresh + easy days always) All that worked. I am now doing 2x4x600m @ 4:30 1k pace and have run quite few closer to 4 min pace to see what pace worked best (Have not raced in 40 years :) My understanding from sirpoc and this thread is that it is the DISTANCE that needs to increase before the speed does to make this work best. My experience has been that if I get more than a few days of blahs in training (tired low NRG) I know that I am doing too much or running too hard. When I do this right - every time I do a thresh session I feel OK at worst and great at best. The hardest thing to deal with is making sure I don't run too fast. Or too much. The strava guys are right - it's very easy to go over that line because this training makes things feel too easy (and boring).",

I run only on dirt roads and there are almost no flat spots on them so in one direction I might be going a little bit uphill and coming back a bit downhill. I used a ring stopwatch that worked well for times but the metronome works better - you can set it to beep every 3rd or 4th step or whatever in time with your footfalls and breathing. So as an example yesterday I was doing 600m repeats and I set the metro to 186 going downhill (longer steps) and 188 uphill and it gets me to the end of the rep within a few seconds of my goal pace without having to constantly check my watch. I also have a bit of a unique situation as I ran into bears 3 times last summer and a cougar once - so I figure the beeping might also keep them away (the beeping kind of sounds like a backup alarm on an excavator tho not so loud as you can adjust the volume).",

Having said that haha… If two variables are independent, then they are uncorrelated. Two variables being uncorrelated does not imply independence, you’ve mixed it up. For example, %LT (expressed as a % of VO2max in this case) and vLT not being correlated COULD mean that the runners with the lower %LT have stronger “anaerobic” systems despite having similar VO2max values. Alternatively, runners with a higher %LT could simply have weaker “anaerobic” systems, again, despite similar VO2max values. How that manifests in this study is the former will be reaching the arbitrarily defined LT at a lower %LT than the latter. This would actually fit into Alois Mader’s lactate threshold model, thus explaining why you see the lack of correlation between %LT and vLT. Test the correlation between %LT and Lactate Max though, and I’d suspect you’ll see a significant relationship. Of course, this is not my field, just something I toy with. Also, the equation you posted is basically just an algebraically rearranged economy curve, no? That's going to require that people go to a lab and get both lactate and oxygen consumption tested. Not sure how that is the universal running formula. BTW, is this universal running formula different from the universal intensity descriptor, CS?

Sounds like another one of these situations where you posit a question no one asked, answer said question, and declare “Eureka”. Just like when you posted you thought what was happening here wasnt due to an increase in aerobic power which should be pretty obvious by the interventions design itself. If the person is doing mostly sweetspot work what would lead you to conclude that they’ve massively increased their vo2 max?",

    "message": "Direct from the study, “Due to the large number of runners, we were not able to arrange a test-run over, e.g., 5000 m or 3000 m for all the runners. However, by collection of race results the same year as the physiological tests were performed, the range of performance was found to be from 8.05 to 13.30 min in 3000 m.” Seems reasonable then that the 1500m-5000m would fit the researchers definition of “long distance runners” and your definition of “highly aerobic events”? Great, so back to %LT and vLT… it’s not simply a shorter race distance I’m talking about, it’s the metabolic profile (meaning both VO2max and Lamax) and muscle fiber profile! Take two runners with the same VO2max but differing lactate max values. To get to the arbitrarily defined LT that this study proposed (baseline lactate plus a constant), the runner with the lower lactate max will be working at a higher percent of their VO2max thus faster relative vLT, than the runner with the higher lactate max. Since, for the runner with the higher lactate max, the intensity (% VO2max) doesn’t need to be as high to generate the arbitrary lactate value. Now, tying that in with the range of athletes in this study and based on the mathematical model of the lactate threshold that Alois Mader defined (which frames the process in terms of the underlying generative mechanism based on ATP, ADP, and AMP production), the variation seen in this study would be well explained, simply, by relatively small differences in Lamax. That would mean %LT and vLT are not actually independent from performance level, as you stated. Rather, vLT is not explained well by %VO2max alone. However, add Lamax to the mix, and both a relationship and explanation appears. This could be referred to as a eureka moment.",

The why is to other people scientifically. However, I don't think that needs be to ditract from guys like Coggan, unbelief, Hard2find really drilling down. I think most people probably can get their heads round what they are saying. If not, it's interesting to learn, as you point out. If you don't have a taste for that, again as someone else mentioned.

One thing I have noticed is that how consistent and lack of cardiac drift they are now getting on their easy runs. Even that now seems much more under control.

Based on the formula LTv=LT%*VO2max/CR, the logic assumption is as better the athlete is (LTv is higher), as higher also LT% should be. Same with VO2max and CR (which gets lower if better). Based on that, the hypothesis was that LT% might improve with training too. And more for Elites as the train more. But this was not found for running. Your paper shared in post #2331, seems to indicate that training age might play a role, as well as muscle fiber topology. I may quote Storen, 2013: Together this seems to indicate, that at least short term adaptation for LT%, for well trained athletes, are unlikely.

I’m not. I also never said I use the Mader model for my training. I don’t. However, I am interested in the various training approaches circulating the running community, so make the effort to learn them. You know, so as not to be bamboozled by INSYCD, as you earlier suggested. Yes, if you have economy and VO2max values, you can use an optimization algorithm to fit vLamax. You’re making my point for me. Most of these studies are measuring VO2max, lactate, and economy anyway. So they could fit vLamax (they could obviously test it too and compare predicted vs observed) and using the experimental data, test how %VO2max at LT correlates with vLamax amongst the group. More simply, just observe how the lactate curve changes when VO2max is held constant and vLamax varies. Does that fit the experimental data of the subjects? Based on the model, that change alone is not far off the range of variation presented in the study, hence why I thought of that potential explanation and responded to lexel. Intuitively it would seem muscle fiber plays the bigger role but vLamax could very well be a reasonable proxy in lieu of muscle biopsy. I don’t know what field you’re in but simulations have been useful in my experience. If for no other reason than to establish a base knowledge and observe the mechanics of a complex system. Regarding lactate testing, I actually liked taking a sample after doing what Joe Vigil would call a 400m tag, but I wouldn’t suggest it because I know you’ll criticize it as being too long and dependent on aerobic metabolism to be of use in assessing purely anaerobic metabolism. Sometimes, it’s interesting to just experiment though. Seems you prefer shaping your training around CS?",

I have not the feeling you got that. As mentioned now several times, in the paper from Stoa, 2020, they had trained experienced athletes. With experienced athletes i mean they do it for a longer time, several years. In the paper 'determinants of endurance in well trained athletes' (post #2331) most of the group L cyclists they had 1-3 years of cycling. That is ridiculous little experience and therefore adaptation time. You call them well trained, that is funny, so i have to reject also this paper for that purpose. As elite train more as recreational athletes and have the higher LTv, you would expect to see statistically higher LT% values for elite. This was not found for running (Stoa, 2020). One theory could be that muscle fibers can only partly transfered (over a longer period of time) i.e. from fast twitch IIa to slow twitch fibers and after several years of training its over, no more adaptation possible. Also what you do in your childhood, might play a significant role. There are individual LT% adaptations between athletes and because a marathoner or you have a higher LT% as the average, that does not prove anything. There is always the argument he is good at marathon because of his high LT% and not the other way around. So there seems to be some evidence, that after years of training LT% is hardly trainable at all. The experienced athlete should then focus on VO2max and CR.",

A couple of other people have pointed to the same. Others seem to be having success with it. Unfortunately, just shows how far behind running power is still.

FWIW, I once followed your logic, and did Hickson-style VO2max intervals (i.e., 6 x 5 min @ 95-100% of VO2max) 3 d/wk for 18 wk in a row. At the end, I recorded my highest VO2max ever (but by <1 mL/min/kg than when following more balanced approaches). However, my sustainable power was actually down, and I got my hat handed to me in the race I was targeting. Hence (in part) the mantra I have shared ever since: Re. big picture: Training for longer, steadier endurance events isn't (and shouldn't be) complicated. The \"Norwegian approach\" a.k.a. \"sweetspot training\" a.k.a. Lydiard's \"best aerobic pace\" is just bog-standard application of what is known from laboratory studies. There's no magic to it.",

They didn't have any answer. Just generic response. With regards to EIM. This in my opinion doesn't really have any similarities. I've done EIM. It's very basic and doesnt give me very good results. I almost feel like the easy runs too hard, the intervals too easy. I think this method laid out is probably a better balance. @Coggan. You really think HR is less variable than lactate? Do you have any studies? Or are you just making a wife assumption? Most runners I know who have used meters and plotted it against HR have found for paces and lactate under similar circumstances corresponded , but HR is the most variable metric. Making it the least meaningful. I hope my English is good to understand this point. Many thanks",

If the total time is similar, you will have higher mileage in the threshold days because you are running faster.

I found that interesting to a point, however I got a bit lost - I doubt I am the only one. I can't say why/how this works. I really can't. I simply decided to trust the rest of the testimonials in this magnificent thread and jump head first into the deep end with nothing more than a HR monitor , flat ground and sirpoc guide and help. I will do the obligatory shout-out to him, as he has answered question I have thrown at him on Strava direct message, no matter how dumb it is. I am for sure that he is sometimes sitting there wishing he never got involved in this thread! I will add the help he has given me is better than any coach. My expectations were not great, as I felt: 1. This goes against everything I was pre-conditioned to understand about running training. What does a guy someone who has only run for two years can teach me about running. 2. I was going to just do the basics. No lactate meter, no setting up my own guide based on paces and lactate curves. Just me, my Garmin, a HR strap I bought and the track/ flat ground. 3. I've seen better days. I'm in my 40s now and my last PB was 2015. The appeal of this was also the limited time aspect. I'm sure I am like others, but simply I do not have time for doubling. My first impressions were there is no way this can work. The sessions felt way, way . Not just a bit, incredibly easy. I remember finishing the first session of 3*10 mins almost chuckling to myself. Then I saw my HR and it was actually not far off LTHR by the end. Just under. Then kind of a light bulb went off. It's meant to feel like that and actually I had a very , very good workout , but the fact I kept myself a decent amount under LTHR meant I didn't really feel beat up . Was it a full threshold workout? No. But as sirpoc says in the guide. Even if you get 90% of the benefit, can you do this three times a week? Absolutely! This is the key. It's that extra workout. I've never been able to do three quality days + a long run a week. It was then difficult also to slow my easy pace down. That was also the key. That just means the day in between , the slower I brought that down the even easier it was to carry out the sub threshold workouts. I found the pace guides provided as well as the spreadsheet that was provided on Strava absolutely fantastic. I really didn't change much. As others have also said, not a lot happened initially. On about week 8 I did a 5k. I was very worried. In the warmup I did 2*400m at just under race pace and i felt really, really bad. There was surely no way I could even race at the pace I had 2 months prior? What a stupid training idea!!! I have gotten worse!! I was cursing sirpoc, this thread, everything. Feeling quite annoyed on the start line. Then, something weird happened. I felt awful again in the first 1km. Like my legs didn't understand this pace. But then, it's very odd. I just kept getting faster per KM. I ended up finishing in 18:10. 23 seconds faster than 2 months before. Just 20 seconds off my PB set when I was 35. Fast forward. Week 22. Almost two weeks ago now. I ran a HM. My PB was the aforementioned one from 2015, my last PB at any distance. I absolutely crushed it. Ran 1:19:34 to beat my PB by a huge margin and broke for my level, what I saw a mythical 80 mins mark. Fast forward again to last weekend 10 days when I was going to post, I figured I must be in really good shape so entered a very small 5k event. Ran 17:17 to crush my 5k PB. I just can't thank this thread enough. What does all this mean? Not a lot. I just thought I would share my thoughts and if anyone is skeptical like maybe I was, this I think really, really does work. Especially for older runners. But for everyone, it probably will provide the week by week, month by month consistency we probably mostly all lack. Do I understand the science behind it? Not sure I still fully do. Also not sure that matters. Hopefully the thread will inspire someone else. Have a great summer season everyone!",

I gradually built up to 7. Following the guide of no more than 25% time doing the sub threshold stuff in terms of a total % of time. The spreadsheet on Strava does all this for you. Hard2find also made a spreadsheet to plan future sessions and build, I used that for the final 10 weeks. Was awesome to use to plan that final build to 7 hours a week. I had two days off during the whole thing over 22 weeks as I was travelling those days. They are both easy days. I didn't need those days off at all. I didn't do anything extra - for real nothing - apart from copying sirpoc training from Strava or what he laid out here. No sperdwork, no 5k pace work, no hills. Nothing. I think that is probably the bit a lot of people get scared by. I know I was. Someone else said it. I felt like I was slower, but I was much, much faster in comparison to myself. Very odd sensation.

I've been using this method myself and with a fellow masters teammate since around December. He has responded way better than me and is probably running times he would have 5+ years ago. When you are in our 50s like us, that's quite incredible. I've had my best start to a year in 2-3 years.

It's like this has been somehow built into this mystery or myth or that something is being hidden. I am a master also on the British Masters scene. The 5k national masters road championship is usually won in a low 15. It was 15:19 I think last year. I placed in the top 30, in something like a mid to high 16. Sirpoc would lap me in a 5k , or close to it, on the track. If he continues to progress at the same rate, there's a good chance he could win the road 5k masters national champs or at least get top 5. Must be all that 5k work I'm doing that helps me almost get lapped versus what he is doing. I have been running 20+ years since cross country in school on cold winter afternoons in the north of England. I've had dozens of coaches who think they know everything about running.

Also not sure if anyone has done periodized version of this training? Have thought for myself running mid distance with 5k max race distance could use this kind of training for summer/fall base then switch up to adding hills, strides in winter. Finally move to race pace stuff in spring. Maybe defeats purpose of long term gains but seems that threshold block from July-November could provide good aerobic base moving into faster stuff. Makes training more conventional but think big takeaway could be running much more controlled effort regularly rather than having big \"hero\" workouts. MoVB",

    "message": "To give a proper answer to this question I'd want more information about your reasoning for wanting to make the change, your short/long term goals, your weekly schedule, and your training/injury histories, because all of those things factor when tweaking elements of this system. But my personal opinion is to avoid tweaking, at least at first, because so much of the beauty/point of the Sirpoc method comes from applying the tested structure: E Q E Q E Q E(LR), which is designed to maximize weekly load within a time constrained period in an infinitely repeatable way, while minimizing injury risk. If you want to deviate from this structure by condensing the schedule, then you're necessarily going to end up doing one of two things: 1. Increasing your load for a given day above what is recommended and introducing risk; or 2. Sacrificing weekly load by cutting back on either the LR or the Q or both Neither is optimal, so if you have the logistical ability to run 7 days a week, my advice is to just run the 7 days a week as prescribed. It's a great bang for your buck / value approach, which again is the entire point of this training. If you're scared about running 7 days because you've historically gotten hurt without a rest day, consider trying this system within prescribed paces for a week or two and see how you feel -- my prediction is you won't have any desire to rest on the seventh day. If you logistically can't run 7 days and need to chop something, in the absence of more info I'd probably cut out the long run and keep a full third Q session as programmed. Eventually once you know the system and your limits you can try to work in more volume onto the E days to open up more intervals on the Q days. But again, the long run is part of this method's special sauce, both in terms of benefits produced in isolation and also in terms of its supportive ability to unlock additional intervals. So if you can keep it, I'd do that.",

I started again as laid out, after another 3 months really started to get the benefit. If you look at sirpoc, he has basically changed nothing in terms of weekly make up, only some increased time. That tells you all you need to know and has stuck to the 7 day schedule and he's STILL improving. I'm in the Strava group myself, it's actually great, fantastic adult discussions like the old days of LR. One thing I notice, the people who have not had success of which there are some , or the few people who have dug themselves into big holes, are the ones who have changed a lot, to the point you couldn't even say it resembles this method. I won't pick on anyone, but there was even a guy with a lactate meter who managed to dig themselves a big hole. The only thing anyone might need to change, is the paces sirpoc put up. Especially if you are starting out and it feels too hard, it probably is. Even if you are within the guide. I've seen sirpoc post, the guide and paces applied to him and we're only a rough area. Although they seem to fit decent for most people, if you are really in aerobically developed, start off slower. I did this, within a month or so I almost now sit absolutely smack bang in the middle of the guide paced. Even then, this post I am replying to hits the nail on the head. Stick to the 7 day schedule unless you absolutely can't, for some reason. I always thought I couldn't run 7 days, now after 3 months of this I can't imagine not running all 7 days.",

    "message": "I'm not so sure. A long run increases the day's load by ~20+ points of TSS over a regular E run, and that's following a peak-stress Q day, and will be followed by another peak-stress Q day, so I think if load management/resting is truly a requirement, I'd probably err on the side of keeping it E and trying to distribute that load over 3 days, over time, to more safely build the load into the week, and make sure the runner continues to feel like they can handle it. And then I think, over time, they'll probably find themselves feeling strong enough to train on that 7th day anyway, which would be the optimal outcome because it represents a more significant increase in weekly TSS. If cutting the day is just for time or convenience and the athlete is reasonably trained then yeah, I think that's a scenario where I'd default to keeping the LR in there and cutting the E. Maybe this is an overcautious approach, but to me the devilish thing about this system is that it's extremely simple as long as you follow the rules , but that means understanding exactly how the rules apply to body, and it also means that you're flirting with the edge pretty much the whole time by design.",

Is that 30% difference in daily load significant to most people? The system suggests not. But to someone with a stated need to manage weekly load? I'd run a few weeks without it first and then see how the person is feeling. I also don't know how much I agree with the idea of adding volume to Q days. To me, the purpose of the Q days is the Q. Not sure how necessary long warmups and cool downs really are with respect to adding weekly TSS (the cooldown in particular is going to be pretty inefficient.) If I recall correctly Sirpoc's stated theoretical preference for building volume in the form of doubles would be to add mileage to easy days to. That makes sense to me (supportive volume first, ultimately use that to increase Q) but perhaps he can weigh in and correct if I'm misremembering.",

I actually did not tweak anything except for run my longrun to 120 mins only because I can't run on Mondays for work reasons, but I run that LR extremely easily. My hole was more caused by running the paces sirpoc described, and also using 4.0-4.5mmol as a rough LT2 without doing a step test. Turns out for me, even after running this program for 6 months, sirpoc's paces are WAY too fast for me. I ended up doing a step test, and found my LT2 is closer to 2.8-3.0mmol. I've been trying to run under that for the last month and once again feel amazing and very fast. My paces for Q days are really more like: 12x3 mins @ HM pace + 5 sec 6x6 mins @ MP + 8 sec 3x12 mins @ MP + 30sec This might feel slow but I get decent TSS and my CTL is back on the climb. And I can tell I am gaining a lot of fitness. Over the last 7 months of starting this program, I have made considerable progress, going from a 20 min 5K to mid 18s, or maybe faster. I did lose 1-2 months from getting into too big of a hole. Have another 5K soon and am excited to see where I'm at.",

Hopefully you are in the Strava group, there's often some pretty good chat there. Personally I would only be adding stuff on to the easy days once you get up to 30-35 mins work in the sub threshold sessions. Since I reached that, I've g one from 40 mins to 1 hour easy run and have done the same from 75 up to 90 mins long run. It doesn't seem like a lot, but over time keeps the grind in an upward curve. I will say right now, I'm a bit stuck as to where to add stuff on. But, the absolute last resort would be to do anything to the Q days. As you have said, the whole thing is pretty much a tightrope as it is. That's probably where the most can go wrong, IMO. If I was going to double, I would start with maybe on a Monday , Wednesday or Friday doing two 35-40 min runs on one of those days, once a week. I've probably gotten to a level beyond what I expected and have become half decent it appears at masters level, so maybe I'll make that commitment when I final reach the limit I can grow my training (which is close). But I don't know, running is just a hobby to me and something to do and keep fit to replace cycling. I sort of agreed with myself I would commit an hour a day and 90 mins on a Sunday maximum. But we will see...... I'm also glad, although I think I've said it before, that you point out this isn't like a magic system. It's still very hard to do. Mentally and sometimes physically just to be bothered to do the same thing over and over again. I'll sound like a broken record, but if I had 3-4 hours a week, I wouldn't train like this. If I had 12 hours a week, I also wouldn't train like this. I still think this is pretty specific to around the 4.5-8 hour range to give it it's full of broadest scope. That just happens to be the majority of people 35+ with busy working lives. I'm glad people are having success, it's a it embarrassing sometimes that people have made me as some sort of guardian for this training, but if it's helped people I'm glad. I think my non running background is probably to my benefit, as I have never ran before this or had engrain in me you must do X Y and Z to be successful.",

There was an interesting reply to his video in the comments:- \"@stephenscullion262 I disagree with you that the saturday workout is the key session in the week for the double threshhold high mileage model. I am a norwegian distance runner and 'our' model is specifically tailored for 1500m to 10km. The double threshhold tuesday and thursday + 2x10x200m hillsprints on saturday is only what you do from october to may, then you lower your mileage slightly and start to train harder closer to the racedays in the spring and summer (around 7-8 mmol for example in may). VO2max is great for running fast, but it is NOT the single most important thing. We have plenty of sub 29 min 10km runners with VO2 max well below 70. Having a control over your lactate and speed in training is the key to consistency (besides eating enough food and sleeping of course). THIS IS NOT A MARATHON MODEL. You can always find a good reason for running faster than threshold, but the reason you find will never be more important than your total volume of threshold training (for 1500m -> 10km/half marathon). It is all about assigning a weight to the good arguments when you have multiple good arguments. Of course you need 'harder' training but, the harder stuff should NEVER be prioritized over mileage when you are not racing during the winter. Of course there is not a one solution that fits every runner, but this is our philosophy. Your ability to not accumulate lactate is MUCH MORE IMPORTANT than your ability to push hard while already having a high amount of lactate in your body, if you run 1500m or longer races. Threshold is a level of intensity, not one specific pace. So how do we solve the ''problem'' of not running fast enough? We use lactate as an INTENSITY LEVEL. Your threshold pace is something that is session-specific. You can obviously run faster at 2.5mmol lactate in a 400m x25 session than you can in a 2000m x6 session. The fastest runner in a distance race is USUALLY the man who has the least stiff legs before the last laps, not the guy who fights for his life while having already stiff legs. Feel free to ask any questions! We still try to find a good model for the marathon in Norway, but we haven't gotten close to anything as good as our 1500m->10000m/half marathon model yet. The norwegian model is also something that will not work for just a couple of months of training. It is a long term model that works best over a few years of measuring and comparing your lactate levels from previous years and increasing your volume every year.\"",

If you had read the thread, you would have seen covered multiple times that there is no magic formula and the creation of enough load, will equal what is happening here. But take sirpoc bike example. Between 2-3 hours a day every day for months at a very easy pace, to create the same load and same result he could in half the time with a mixture of sweetspot. You probably could achieve the same results with less intensity, but take longer doing it. But what on earth is the point? Literally the whole point of this is to maximize the most amount of load you can, for someone who has a limited amount of time, but also who can maybe give a decent amount of time for their week.

It's long slow improvement and Americans don't do that kind thing very well. That's why the other methods are more popular - take a kid with not much training - beat the crap out of him doing intervals for a month or two and he DOES improve for the season. But not so much down the road. I know because thats all we ever did in HS and college training. I never had a coach who said - hey let's see how much better u can be 2 years from now.",

The 10x3 would be run faster which would therefore be run at a higher percentage of Threshold. Thus, the 10x3 would earn a higher TSS. Also, the 3.5 exponent causes any percentage other than 100% to be adjusted to be further from 100%. For example if you ran at 99% of threshold, the 3.5 exponenet would adjust that percent to 96.5%. 101% would be adjusted to 103.5%. 90% would be adjusted to 69.2%.",

    "message": "The advantage to using some kind of data outside of pure pace is to verify, or at least semi-accurately guesstimate, where your LT2 is. Once you know that, you can jump into a 3 ST session workload immediately, no real need to build up to it like you would a real workout. The disadvantage to using pace based off a race result is that bodies are different and there’s a chance you may hit LT2 before that pace (a number of people have reported that in the Strava group). To me, the worst case scenario would be spending weeks/months building up to repeats that are too fast to be sustainable but not realizing it because you don’t have a sense for the RPE and you think this is supposed to feel harder than it is, then eventually realizing things aren’t working and having to spend even more time resting and/or dialing it back. It can’t be stressed enough — overwork is easy to do if you don’t know what we’re doing, because we’re literally talking about a difference of seconds per KM per repeat, and it can really sneak up on you, even intra-workout. If you must freestyle, then I would take some time to read the descriptions of RPE shared by people who have been doing this a while and confirmed their impressions with measurements. There’s a thread in the Strava group and a few comments in this one as well.",

The piece I feel is overlooked is the amount of time at sub t. It seems like most people on the Strava group are jumping right into 25% of weekly time. It may be wise to start at 20% and see how you respond. If you're at 6hr weekly, 8x 3min will give you most of the stimulus needed (20%). It's the last 2 reps/ 6 min where you're most likely to tip over. In the big picture it's the 3rd quality workout with a 'long run' that creates the load over time and 20% will get you there with less risk. I'm starting at 20% of time because I'm coming back from injury and faster running is more likely to irritate my hip. After reading others' experiences, it seems like some time at 20% sub t volume may be helpful because it is such a tight rope act. It's nice to give yourself room to grow as well.",

Is it because he’d miss out on a physiological adaptation that the 10 min reps give you that the 3 min reps won’t give you?",

Obviously these workouts would not be the same difficulty. But they would have the same TSS because the duration and the fraction of threshold pace/critical power is the same for all of them. I think some of you don't understand math very well. The formula uses duration of the run and the fraction of threshold pace/critical power that the workout was run at. If the duration and the percent of threshold are the same, then the score is the same. If the duration is the same but the percent of threshold is different, then the workout with the higher percent of threshold will yield a higher score. Any time not running is not counted. You need to understand that the score does not tell you how effective a workout is. It is just a way to approximate the stress of the workout.",

Only? I don’t know about temperature relative to your running Tuesday or how well you’re acclimated to the heat, but that’s definitely warm enough to affect running, especially workouts and races. 2. How many times have you done this? Maybe you’re just adjusting to the schedule of running sub-threshold 48 hour apart. 3. I’d worry less about single data points. Trends are more important. That’s true for how you feel, paces, and HR. And, of course, lots of factors can affect HR. Because of cardiac drift, you can’t compare average HR across a 3-mile run with that for a 10-miler, and the same will go for shorter reps at a given pace than longer ones. Add in the efffect of sleep, nutrition, hydration, stress, etc., and there are many variables to consider.

This is, however, full of limitations. In the sense that some people might not have access to a flat route, a track, or even the same route week to week. Everything has it's limitations with the lack of available reliable power. This is the big issue, on the bike, literally ignoring all over factors. I'll know I can pretty much always hit my sweetspot power target for the session. Whilst stuff like pace, HR etc might be different, I never even tracked or looked at them, let alone worried about them. Power is power in a simplistic point of view and it made my training on the bike versus running now so much easier to the point it's almost frustrating, despite using basically the same method, with everything just dialled back a notch to account for the genuine beating and impact strain running puts on the body. I speak to Jiggy and Shirtboy on a regular basis, we all have different needs for how we account for our training loads.

Which, hopefully isn't the case . Or I at least didn't mean that to be the result. Ultimately and simplistically, we are just looking to increase load as much as we can without breaking down. I still think that probably this is the best way for most people, but there's also adaptations I've seen that I know have worked for others, but I know wouldn't work for me and vice versa. One thing I will add, a lot of people don't have good data. This really is a problem if you want to go back and look at patterns. All of this talk and metrics, load and how much you can accumulate, it's only useful if you actually know your current fitness on a semi regular basis. It relies on honesty, which we often don't like as we don't like to believe we are on \"only\" a certain shape when we feel we should be faster etc. I've spoken to a lot of people now and this is the a absolute biggest problem I run into, which then also leads to them running way too fast on workouts and easy runs. Anyway, sorry I digress as it sort of links in and thought I would mention it whilst I'm on one of my frequently rare trips to the thread.",

    "message": "The confusion is from people not using a universal system. Since we are of significantly different capabilities, especially when we look at world class athletes too, the comparisons to race times fall apart. The more important metric is what paces you can hold for certain durations like 30mins (CV pace), 60mins, etc. Like look at HM pace. For a world class runner that’s very close to a 60min race. So their HM pace is the pace they can hold for 60mins. If you run a 90+ min HM, then your HM pace is a significantly different intensity and will have a significantly different effect when you train at that pace. When people here are putting workout paces in terms of race paces, it’s inevitably individualized, not a flawless universal recommendation. Similarly, if you measure the intervals by distance rather than duration, then you are running much longer intervals than the elites. A 400m rep can end up being nearly 2mins long for a runner in this thread, whereas Jakob is running it in just over a minute. You’d be nearly doubling the volume of the workout by going by distance rather than duration. As a starting point I prefer converting everything to duration and completely forgetting about distance. So think about what pace you can hold if you go all out for 30mins, for 60mins, or for 120mins. And for the workouts, measure intervals by time, not distance, so 25 x 1min instead of 25 x 400m. I personally do: 10 x 3min (1min rest) @ 60min pace 5 x 6min (1min rest) @ 120min pace 25 x 1min (30s rest) @ 30min pace And I sometimes do continuous marathon tempos integrated into a long run (a notch slower than the 6min reps) for some race specific work. But it’s not like I’ve run time trials and really know what those paces are, so in the end I am looking at race paces and estimating a pace a bit faster or slower than them. The approximations you’ve written (like doing 1600’s at 10mi pace) are accomplishing the same thing if they’re done appropriately for your race times. So that gets you closer to doing known effective workouts. Now I personally only do two of these a week. Whereas Jakob can do 4 as well as another race specific day of work like hills at mile pace or whatever he does. I’m hoping over time I can increase workout frequency and/or volume, but until my fitness plateaus it’s not a priority. The only thing I need to be careful of is increasing the paces of the workouts too much and making them too intense. I’d rather increase mileage or increase workout frequency than change the nature of the workouts. IMO a number of people are doing their reps too long and too slow (because they’re copying elites but they’re copying distance instead of duration and they’re copying paces in terms of race distance rather than race duration), but if they’re happy and they’re improving, good for them.",

I think people are also forgetting the clear advice given that 1. There is no threshold pace here, we are just looking to create the state of threshold and 2. Still the vast majority of your running is going to be easy 75/25 split. Sirpoc last week for example ran only 22% by my calculation of his weekly minutes at sub threshold according to strava. The rest was very, very easy for his level, just look at the very low heart rate, hugely under the 70% cap he mentioned. I see a lot of people in the Strava group doing a lot and in some cases, way more than 22%, probably north of 30+ and their eaay runs do not look easy.

He has progressed and we can relate to him and in my opinion he's still one of the only ones following his method true. I think there are too many people changing too much. But that is just my view. One thing I learned the hard way, was the easy runs really you should listen to this 70% max HR guide. I go by feel, what feels easy to me actually isn't. The first few months 76-78% max HR really caught up with me. As soon as I checked my ego in and went slower, I started to really progress. If you look at sirpoc easy runs, aside from after that usual 10-15 mins everyone gets where your body starts working, there's almost no cardiac drift. Even by the end of an hour or 90 mins run. It's quite remarkable. Easy really should mean easy. If you look at what Seiler says, despite his limitations, basically if you are truly below LT1 you should see a pretty flat HR plot after the first 10 mins. I asked sirpoc this direct on Strava, he says still even to this day he will very slowly run or even walk up any steep inclines he encounters. If that is good enough for a 15 min master 5ker then I can certainly check my ego at door and do the same. Obviously with my experience I am slow, but just used the paces sirpoc mentioned but did as suggested, moved them from distance to time. Tbh, maybe I won't even get to 3k repeats but the 12 minutes mentioned by sirpoc instead will work just fine. As do the 3min repeats instead of 1k. I am improving massively, that's all that matters. Also, to the guy who made the pod. Very nice. Nothing wrong with that at all. Honestly, there's other places you could take it and if you could convince sirpoc himself the actual first hand background and story of him and his success is incredibly interesting, that's totally aside from the fact of all the interest he's shown in the what works, doesn't work etc of all this.",

What you're both getting at is trying to find a better pace rule to guide the training intensity. The issue is that you need both power and duration to make a prescription for someone. That's highly individual. What you both propose, along with Sirpoc, is basically just how to get started and help most people on average. But I don't care about the average--I care about me! It makes no difference to me if your system on average is better than Sirpoc's. Consistency, I've thought about going based on 60 min or 90min pace as well rather than distance PRs. The interesting thing is that if you are right most people would be undershooting their lactate values at the end of sessions (unless they're faster than sirpoc). But the opposite ends up happening; Sirpoc's paces are too fast for most. This is a case where works on average doesn't have much utility. Everyone just has to start, be consistent with how they monitor and make intelligent adjustments. The people with success either know their body/ RPE really well and are approaching things conservatively, or have done lactate testing and are monitoring intensity post session.",

That means from his muscle fiber topology he has more slow twitch fibers than most others, he creates less lactate as others and his lactate clearance is higher than others. That means more fast twitch fiber type athletes (i.e.most people) Rep descriptions like (8-10) x 3min@95%CV; 60-90sec rest and (5-7) x 5min@90%CV are still very solid advices for most athletes.

Repeat ideas like a parrot and then when he is wrong he vanished into his turtle shell and comes back when he thinks we forgot. As for the rest of your post. Excellent points. Obviously knowing your whole lactate curve is best and testing. But I have had great success with the paces from page 1 without being tweak much. At first I was very much on slower end. Now I am actually sometimes faster than sirpoc guide pace on short repeat. I think he says it's just a guide to go as starting point. That is very much how I interpret it and tweak paces for individual. What I would never tweak is two factor. 3x sub threshold a week and 4x easy runs. This formula just seems standard and I also play around stupidly as others so at other points and it just creates unbalance. I have now manage 29 straight weeks basic as this. OK, so I not as fast as sirpoc and will never be. But I have knocked 3 minutes off my 5k PB. Hey, it makes me seem superstar now at my local races to my friends, so I am happy 😊 My took is primitive and I have made very big progress as note. All I did was the friel field LTHR test and simple to make sure I do not go over LTHR value end of workout or especially during. This is almost basic as you can get and it work believe me and I was someone who was massive skeptical when I first read this thread. I feel super fresh compare to anything I have done before. I look back now and feel idiot for destroying myself doing those 6-8*800 track workouts and equivalents. I work in the science field in my career path and whilst I like to want answers in field I work in, all I care about here is being faster running. I just don't see how anything lexel propose can help make anything better. If you have your 5k pace recent and Lthr you confident with, it almost plug and play. Maybe after 2-3 sessions you realise paces might be not quite for you, but it's a decent wide range. Then off go. I don't see how converting anything or everything into % of CV/CS going to improve anything. That what we are trying to do here, right? I want and strive to be better for myself as slow runner who is now less slow and inspired by Strava group and other progress, obviously especially sirpoc. By the way, to the guy who did nice podcast. Also well done. It was nice summary and agree with others you should do follow up with man himself sirpoc. I think people almost really interested in human story behind this. There's many questions more I'm sure we could all ask. Maybe a Q and A session. I think it would go wide as I see this talk on Reddit as well so would expand your pod. Just my thought. Maybe as I write this I am overly harsh to lexel. But I think he can be better person and take some critical on board. The thread isn't about him being right or about him and I think personal he wants it to be or us to say 'well done Lexel, you were right all along! Let's just forget all the success and do it your way!' Or at least that how he communicates. I hope my English isn't too bad, I don't get to write in it much these days.

    "message": "Really interesting. Just started seriously checking HR on runs and have been pretty shocked how much slower paces are. Previously assumed easy feel of 8:30-8:50 pace was just normal run but finding that keeping HR in low 130s needs almost a minute slower. It has felt painfully slow but did notice pretty much any hill makes HR climb to 150 then makes way back down. Never thought of walking a hill, my HS coach would be screaming at me for walking on a run! But realizing that gonna have to unlearn a lot of my previous training habits and also \"check ego.\" As always, really appreciate people sharing this and asking questions! MoVB",

    "message": "I'm yet another one of the annoying people who messaged sirpoc on Strava. Maybe by now he's fed up with us all! But the post you replied to also stuck a chord with me, in the sense what always catches my eye is how easy his HR is on easy runs as i also asked him about this. I asked him how he does it and he simply said run slow and check your watch lol sounds simple. I think we overlook how disciplined he is. I think that is truly part of the success. Maybe being a slave to the metrics is truly the best way for best results? Hard for some of us to get heads round as experienced runners. His pace can vary a bit / got faster as he's got faster. But that HR average is always below that 70% mark mentioned, as we know and have seen his max HR somewhere in the low to mid 190s. So 125-33 average what we see for him is truly easy. Remember, it's not about pace. Your body does not have a measuring guage in it. It has no idea how far you run. Just knows how long and for what effort. Easy run I think in this thread hugely overlook. Very hard to do the workouts 3 times a week if you are running even steady rather than truly easy.",

    "message": "This is interesting. I was a multi eventer back in my university days and definitely on the faster twitcher side (jumping events were my strongest point, nowadays my legs are still twice the size of most on the start line for distance races), in my older age (nearly 40), the past couple of years I've been trying to convert to distance (now 36min 10k PB - hobby jogger territory but improving). I've tried the sub threshold method for a couple of months last fall but found it more draining than it should (compared to traditional training weeks, ie one faster interval session, one tempo) and was going backwards whilst also dealing with niggles so gave up. Didn't really match many people's experience here. I wonder if this could be the reason, ie need to slow it down far more than specified by the spreadsheets. I was always conservative, but perhaps not enough. For a faster twitch athlete should the easy/long runs be slower too? I guess sub 70% HR max is already very slow (8 min mile) though so maybe not. I guess lactate testing would probably be the only way of truly finding out for the ST intervals. Keen to give it another go but hesitant after the last attempt. Thanks for bringing up the muscle fibre type point, one of my training partners who is definitely slow twitch has really thrived with a SubT approach using the same pace guide, whilst I struggled. Feels like this could be the reason why.",

Like others have mentioned, folks here are interested in getting results. We're primarily practitioners and make only as many theories as necessary. The main thing, is that there is a very solid blueprint for what success with this method looks like. Sirpoc didn't want the thread to be about him, but he's the baseline for the model and I think that's a good thing. I agree with the other posts who discourage folks from straying off course.",

I actually have the EIM book but haven't tried implementing it, I've a long history of achilles tendinopathy and it looked like a recipe for aggravating that...Not convinced heavy loading daily is conducive to tendon health. Partly why this approach appeals as its a bit more gentle than EIM by having the de-loading days between efforts. Tempted to consider trying something of a hybrid approach though as long continuous efforts definitely hurt me more than they should (eg feel better after a short/fast session than say a 8 mile upper Z2). I think a point of confusion for me is whether fast twitch athletes should play to their strengths by going faster/shorter and recruiting more FT fibres, or doing subT even slower to strengthen weaknesses (more ST). Probably depends on race target, 5-10k is my preference. I'm absolutely not a physiologist and stabbing blindly in the dark. Great that there's so many knowledgeable people on here (and a few trolls)!",

But surely that isn't hard? That really is an easy run to me. But then again by the end by HR is maybe 15-20 BPM higher than the start? Other thing I noticed. Did anyone else notice the difference between sirpoc and KI? Very similar apart from sirpoc probably being a hair faster. No, their cadence. Absolutely crazy difference in cadence.

It never quite felt like proper training though, like I wasn't really doing enough even though at similar overall mileage.

It almost feels like I really haven't run. Whereas something like 12-15K easy can feel truly easy (effortless, breathing 4/4 (at 160 cadence), although HR usually around 80%), but I'm going to be aware of it all day, even if in a pleasant way.

    "message": "Hi all, I’ve really enjoyed this thread, it’s made me think at length about the approach I’ve had to training over the decades. Before we even get to the details of lactate etc, the idea of doing sessions at non-maximal intensity is a novel one for me. I wish I’d known about it in my 20s! It’s early days (I’ve been doing this style of training for just under two months) but it’s interesting that I ran a slight “old man” PB (I’m in my late 40s) in the 16:40s on the weekend, vs my previous of just under 17min. I’m currently doing about 80km/week (50mi/week), which is more than I’ve done for a few decades and keeping in mind it’s winter here in Australia. So perhaps it’s also possible my 5k result came from increased mileage. But of significance is that at no point during the last two months have I run to the point of being a crumpled heap at the end of a session – something that was unthinkable in my previous approach to training, at any mileage. I’d collapse 2-3 times a week previously after a session of hard intervals. Now, two questions I have, which I don’t think have been covered (I read the first 60 pages of this thread before it sort of degenerated, but I’ve been keeping up again since about p125): We all know Jakob is a handy 1500m runner, but most on this thread seem to be longer distance specialists. For me, 5k is as long as I race seriously and my main interest is the 1500m, probably more closely followed by 800m but then I enjoy the 3k/5k a lot too. Perhaps you can get away with training like this for 1500, just, but it’s hard to imagine it being good for the 800m? Or perhaps it is a good way to build base during the winter, then switch to (or include) more traditional lactic tolerance type training come summer. But has anyone here applied this as a middle distance runner? Secondly… what about this as a method for kids? I have seen some say that part of the strategy with this approach is high overall mileage. I have a daughter in her early teens, also focused on middle distance running. We’re doing a few of these longer, low-intensity type sessions which she’s handling well. But her total mileage is maybe 30km/ week (about 20mi/week). I’m reluctant to dial total weekly volume up for a young athlete… is the Norwegian approach therefore one that should wait a few years? We don’t have a lactate meter, and I’m still relying on some ‘gut feel’ for intensity (I haven’t even done a Friels test yet) but, we both seem to be recovering well from the sessions. I am to do my easy runs at around 130bpm and long intervals maxing out at 160bpm. I suspect my max is around 180bpm (but don't know - haven't been wearing the HR strap all that long). Anyway, thanks again to so many of the contributors on this thread – really interesting stuff.",

Faster twitchers following the specified SubT schedule are possibly leaving something on the table whilst the current outline seems ideal for slow twitchers. Fast twitchers should consider shorter/faster reps and slightly lower volume eg 10-15x400s (10k pace) and 45s jog recovery (not passive), 20-25x200s (35s jog). Obviously this lower volume would lead to lower CTL, but this is probably better for FT. Longer reps and CTL maximisation makes sense for ST.",

The usual story, work events, charity runs, turkey trots etc. I was really slow, happy with 21-22. I came across this thread like many others I am sure, simply by mistake. First few pages seemed interesting and I've had it pinned to my taskbar ever since. I was already doing 5-6 days a week and 5+ hours , so I thought this method might work for me. Upped it to 7 and followed the normal schedule. Firstly, the paces were way too fast. Which I had suspected being A) slow and B) good knowledge of my fibre make up. In fact, I had to go super slow to make it work loosely using HR as a guide. I would say that maybe 10-12 weeks I felt terrible. Truly awful. In fact I was just about to give up because I just felt this wasn't made for me and back to shorter, harder stuff. But then I entered a 5k purely for fun to run with my wife and I actually PB'd by a good 30 seconds. From maybe a week or so after that, my body felt like it had changed. The grind feeling was gone and I could run the paces on the lower end of the spreadsheet someone shared on Strava. Now, another 3-4 months on and a bigger drop of my PB - sub 19, I can run actually nearer the faster end of thr guide paces. But took me a long, long time to get there.

    "message": "This is encouraging. In response to Alfie as well, I have a few things to add. I just concluded my spring track season, and some friends that I can beat in 800m and mile races have gone on longer summer runs for XC with me. I noticed that in the first mile I feel fine, but by the 4th mile I’m getting dropped by guys that are 10s slower than me in the mile. This is pretty frustrating, and I was trying to figure out what happened, was it just a bad day, did I underfuel, etc, but it has happened multiple times. I’m pretty sure I’m a FT guy, because I can run a good 200, 400, 800, decent mile, and then everything falls apart when I get to the 5k. I have XC season approaching in the fall and I would like to be a fast XC as well as track runner. I have been using this method for about 6 weeks since I stopped training with the team (interval focused, fast strides almost every day). It’s only been recently that I actually feel ok on the easy runs, and don’t feel incredible fatigue by the end. The 3min intervals feel super easy to me, 5min intervals are alright, and I’ve tried to do some 8min intervals and I just feel like a cow. I wonder if since I’m in the offseason, this is when I work on that aerobic weakness, or am I doomed to always be lagging on the long runs with the team but dominate the 200m repeats, as has happened this track season? The other thing is that I might not be necessarily FT, but just aerobically undertrained (only been running for 2 years, consistently for 6 months as of now) Times: 26 (hand-timed time trial, alone), 56, 2:08, 4:56, don’t have a recent 5k",

    "message": "The Ingebrigtsens are ALL 1500m specialists FIRST for the most part - this thread and the Strava group are filled with NON-1500m runners - and I think they have mostly adjusted the training to fit the longer races - for example - KI and Sirpoc do 3x3200m reps and rarely or never do the 400m reps. For them I think this is a reasonable alteration - but for 1500m type runners I think it might be unnecessary. The original Ingebrigtsen training seems to concentrate on 400m 1k and 2k reps and nothing longer. That's what 1500m specialists should do IMO. I also don't see a huge utility in long runs for 1500m runners. There was someone on the strava thread who said he never did ANY runs longer than 1600m and PR'd his HM time. I also question the emphasis on so much Easy mileage - if the entire point of easy days is to recover - it matters not how many of those miles you do - perhaps it is only necessary to do some minimum mileage as just a way to make sure your body MOVES on those days and flushes all the waste products from your system. I don't know. But it seems to me the THRESHOLD runs are the 95% training and all the other stuff - long runs, easy days, hills etc - those are last 5% training. One last thing - using distance for the threshold reps I think is a mistake - CTL and other type measurements are a version of something weight lifters have known and used for decades - you improve your hypertrophy and strength based on Time Under Tension. 5 slow reps can beat 10 fast ones because the TIME the muscle is being subjected to stress is greater. I think thresholds are the same - you don't target 10x1k or 25x400m - instead you target the hours per week. Look at 10x1k for Jakob versus 10x1k for a hobby jogger like me - a session like that is 50+ minutes for me - it might be HALF that time for Jakob. And since all these reps vary little in pace ( a few seconds per k faster or slower depending on the distance of the rep) - in the end all that matters is the TIME you spend doing threshold reps during any given week. And the distance of any specific rep might be mostly irrelevant. As u get faster u naturally end up doing more threshold mileage even while keeping the total time the same. Lots of slightly different ways to skin this cat.",

If you are doing 3x sub T workouts in the week, you should be treating those easy days always more conservative than you think you should run them. Those are not there to generate extra stress. If anything, always round these runs down any way you can (or with whatever metric you are using to track them) to not compromise the other sessions and unnecessarily add fatigue. I struggle with this myself. When i start feeling good I always fall for the false choice of speeding up the easy days. Never fails. But it always fails me. I made this mistake last fall and have been trying to be very conservative with these, since they are there to only glue together the real work in the week. For reference, last fall i would set my 'cap' so to speak at 75% of MHR. This year ive been adamant about staying under 70% MHR and even WELL under that with much better day to day fatigue response.",

For aerobic power - avoid LT pace runs, substantially slower tempo, or faster than LT but broken up...suggests short intervals at 3-10k pace with short rests to train FT fibres aerobically. Says that FT respond better to 5k/10k pace work than LT pace. Anaerobic work - FT can handle more, long rests between intervals, however cautions about doing too much anaerobic volume if you're targeting 5k/10k+ to avoid inhibiting your aerobic capacity. Also emphasises the need for FT to maintain stimulus on FT fibres: sprint work (8-10s) should be used. Lower mileage required than ST. There are various other interesting bits about t",

I kind of like this long distance stuff, the longevity is there! I can still probably run a decent 400 in an age group race though. It's maybe there at the end of a 5k now I'm aerobically half decent as well. But I don't think speed or sprint exists in the way people think it does? Unless I have the aerobic engine there's no real way to use it. It's more like who is just slowing down less rather than sprinting at the level I race 5ks. I am glad to see my post got some good feedback. Hope it genuinely gives some help. Because it probably did take me twice as long as most people seem to mention to get the results , being so fast twitch, but in the end, we got there.

Shamelessly copying his schedule from Strava, but with not quite as much time but the caveat of that I am aiming for the same amount of time spent sub threshold. So that's nothing apart from the 3 sessions a week. So I do think it can work across the spectrum, as by the looks of things and from what people have said I couldn't be more fast twitch and him more slow twitch. I think patience is the key to all of this. The whole thread in fact. It's not going to create the miracle pill the internet wants, but it'll slowly get you there. But this is not for the ones who want results in 6-8 weeks even. Probably, even slower if your muscle fibers are more like mine. But hopefully hope that we can all get there in the end.

For example, here's a review article Ed published almost 30 y ago pulling together these and other studies to describe the \"three-legged stool\" of performance ability.",

    "message": "Working in a far more competitive environment in a country with much greater income inequality, I of course get paid more than Seiler. As for cardiac drift, as I said many times before, it is simply a fact of life, both below and above so-called \"LT1\" (although of course greater at higher vs. lower intensities). Consider, for example, this classic study by Gunnar Ahlborg: Despite the fact that the participants were exercising at only 30% of VO2max (not really much above a fast walk), such that lactate concentrations never rose significantly above resting levels, HR rose from 104 beats/min after 40 min of exercise to 129 beats/min after 240 min. Of course, training diminishes cardiac drift, such that you might not see such a large change in more highly trained individuals (although note that VO2peak while cycling averaged 52+/5 mL/min/kg in these non-cyclists, meaning that their VO2max was 55-60 mL/min/kg). Nonetheless, what these (and numerous other) data demonstrate is that there is really no connection between changes in blood lactate and cardiac drift (nor would you expect one in the first place). ETA: Here's another example, this time in ultramarathon runners tested on a treadmill at 65-70% of VO2max over the same duration. Despite the fact that: \"Blood lactic acid concentration (LA) remained relatively unchanged during the 4 h of exercise and close to resting values. After 45 min of exercise LA was 0.6 +/- 0.2 mmol/l compared with 0.7 +/- 0.2 mmol/l at the 165th min and 0.9 +/- 0.3 mmol/l at the end of the exercise period (Fig. 1).\" significant cardiac drift still took place: \"Cardiac frequency (fn) rose as a linear function of time from the 80th to the 240th min: fn (beats/min) = 143 + 0.124 t (min); r = 0.99\" [(240-80)*0.124 = 20 beats/min, or from 143 to 163 beats/min.]",

So we have a central, a peripheral and also a central governor factor included and all that defines LTv!! Look at the paper i shared (Stoa, 2020), where Elite athletes have a VO2max in the range of 4.42 +- 1.15 L/min, 71.2 +-8.3ml/kg/min. That is a big range. The Elite athletes with the lower VO2max can only compete by having a better running economy and/or a higher LT%. So it is individual and it depends. Which factor is more important is not so easy to distinguish. All three factors have their importance.",

    "message": "Of course there is individual variation - so what? That doesn't alter general conclusions about what limits endurance performance in homo sapiens. \"Threshold\" can be quantified in various ways, but the reason I have used quotes is because I have been talking about the concept, not any specific implementation thereof. Fiber type may be one contributing factor, but it's mostly about muscle respiratory capacity. In that regard, a trained individual who has more type II fibers can very well be superior to an untrained person with lots of type I fibers. Running economy has nothing to do with Noakes' flawed hypothesis of a \"central governor\". Instead, it most closely related to things like leg spring stiffness, the distance between the ankle joints and the insertion of the Achilles tendon, etc. IOW, more the biophysics of tissue properties than motor control. Finally, part of the reason that it is difficult to sort out these factors is that they are interrelated, making any distinctions somewhat arbitrary. Again, consider muscle respiratory capacity: on the one hand, it is the key determinant of the metabolic response to exercise (\"threshold\"), but on the other it likely also influences VO2max, by helping maintain O2 extraction despite reduced capillary mean transit time. But, building conceptual models like the \"three-legged stool\" is how humans make sense of data, even if at the end of the day they are an imperfect representation of reality.",

    "message": "The easy long run isn't just for creating space for recovery in training, but also building the capacity for recovery. The specific stimulus of keeping a long easy effort helps develop metabolic flexibility and general capacity in the mitochondria that only faster running probably doesn't accomplish. This important for performance at the longer events 10k+, and important for general fitness and the capacity to adapt to all types of training in any event 1500m+. As soon as the effort crosses over LT1 into that sub-threshold territory the cells by necessity will start to shift from away fat metabolism towards more carbohydrates to keep up with rate of energy demand. It's still mostly aerobic but there will be little bit more anaerobic metabolism. It's subtle shift, but still does change the internal signaling somewhat. For most of the folks in this thread (key word: lower mileage) I think it's particularly valuable to keep an easy longer run in (~17-22% of weekly volume) because they generally aren't getting any long singles in on the normal easy/recovery days or a huge amount of easy volume in general. For an athlete that is higher overall volume and regularly getting some relatively long singles in on normal easy days they could probably afford to ditch the long run, or rather their \"long\" run just doesn't look particularly long against their normal runs.",

I don't believe that it's more mitochondria unless you are constantly under fueling, because chronic calorie deficit= slightly lowered basal metabolic rate. So by the same logic, to optimise mitochondrial numbers we have to eat enough to maintain maximal basal metabolic rate. However, mitochondrial density can increase hugely, by an increase in the size of each mitochondrion, and this requires a lot of work at every intensity for several weeks. In other words, good old fashioned training methods that have been around for about 70 years.

    "message": "As has been known for decades, muscle mitochondria aren't separate little \"footballs\". Rather, they exist in an interconnected reticulum, which is undergoing constant and surprisingly (to some) rapid fusion and fission. It is therefore really a mistake to think in terms of the size or number of mitochondria - what matters is the overall volume. Be that as it may, the primary effect of endurance training is simply to increase the overall quantity of enzymes, cytochromes, etc., involved in cellular respiration. In part, this is due to a greater density of christae, i.e., for a given mitochondrial volume more of the necessary elements are packed into a more elaborated inner membrane. Secondarily, however, training does have a small impact on mitochondrial \"quality\" (properties), such that skeletal muscle mitochondria more closely resemble those found in the heart (no, Jane, a mitochondrion is not a mitochondrion is not a mitochondrion). Holloszy's classic studies first reported and described this in the late 1960s, it is just a point frequently overlooked by the emphasis on expansion of the overall mitochondrial volume. In any case , I am clueless as to why you think this really has anything to do with food intake/resting metabolic rate. Non-contracting muscle uses very little ATP, with the heart, liver, and kidneys together demanding as much O2/blood flow as all muscles in the body combined. As for the Norwegians, I haven't really paid any more attention to how they train than I do any other athletes (i.e., essentially none). My impression from threads like this one, though, is they do a lot of what I would call \"sweetspot\" training. Quelle surprise, of course, because the latter is really nothing more than the cogent application of exercise training principles like specificity and overload.",

Unfortunately my old WSU credentials did not let me access it and I’m not interested enough to cough up $25 for access to one paper. So I can only see the first page and two of the tables. I’m not a research scientist and haven’t done the best at utilizing the learning from my genetics and cell bio degree in a professional capacity, but I still think I have enough knowledge in physiology to get the gist of what’s going on here and how it may apply to running training. From my limited view, calling this study “All time champion” of anything related to the topics discussed in this thread seems laughable to me. The study: What was measured: What wasn’t done (at least from my limited view into the study): They took six poorly trained guys and made them train very hard for five months, the guys demonstrated massive improvement in certain muscle characteristics, but how much of this is relevant in the context of reasonably well-trained distance runners looking to optimize performance within an existing workload? I fail to understand how anything in this study invalidates my earlier statement: “The specific stimulus of keeping a long easy effort helps develop metabolic flexibility and general capacity in the mitochondria that only faster running probably doesn't accomplish.” From what I can see there’s nothing to demonstrate that they wouldn’t have done as well or better with different training methods, or that this isn’t just all noobie gains of making unfit people train hard consistently. From what I can see the study has nothing to do with any concept of metabolic flexibility, nor can demonstrate one way or the other what good training methods are for developing metabolic flexibility. What is the actual comparison of SDH in these subjects to the elite runners that you reference? What I’ve found so far is pretty inconsistent, but is generally still higher than what the participants in the Gollnick study achieved. How relevant is an increase of SDH in a muscle biopsy if we aren't connecting it to actual performance or comparing other training methods? My understanding is that our methods to see what's going on in the mitochondria are pretty limited in how they correlate to actual performance. I’m supposed to be the idiot here and I’d love to be proven wrong to become slightly less of an idiot, but thus far it seems like you may be a little out of your depth.",

Like many coming into the thread late, Coggan may be a victim of tl;dr syndrome. Thus, his posts come across as non-sequiturs.

On the second, what this study clearly demonstrates is that large volumes of low to moderate intensity exercise are neither required nor most time-efficient for increasing muscle respiratory capacity. It, along with a wealth of other literature, disproves the common misconception that lower intensity exercise is a greater stimulus for mitochondrial biogenesis, as you initially claimed/implied (same is true for capillarization...if you want lots of capillaries, at least to a point you need to train harder but shorter, not longer but easier). TL,DR: As anyone working in the field knows, Holloszy's famous \"two-fold\" increase in muscle mitochondrial enzyme activities in rats is difficult to match in humans, but this study managed to do so, despite the fact that the participants were only training 4 h/wk. Similar results have been obtained with even lower volumes of HIIT. The benefits of a higher volume of training/individual long workouts can be debated, but clearly they aren't required to maximize muscle respiratory capacity as you first asserted.",

The real context that physiology knowledge is applied in matters, real athletes matter, and real performance matters. Is some of the \"best\" stuff physiologists can bring to the table really just a protocol that made six unfit 30s Pullman guys into averagely fit guys by making them train hard on a bike 4x /week? But there's no performance outcome, nothing the average person cares about, just an increase in some enzymes in small pieces of muscle. If it's so difficult to match Holloszy's \"two-fold\" increase from the rat studies maybe we should question if a study on six dudes in Pullman really demonstrates any semblance of a reliable protocol to match that or if other factors may be contributing to such an exceptional result. Meanwhile real world coaches and athletes are running experiments on a much larger scale and at a much higher level. I've ran some pretty intense experiments in Pullman myself, sometimes alongside six other dudes, sometimes a few more dudes, on the real dirt/grass/track, where real results matter. We didn't take muscle biopsies but I'd bet the wheat farm that our SDH was higher than anyone in that study. Maybe what I said was about long runs and mitochondria was wrong?

    "message": "I don't know exactly what the physiological differences in training benefit are one way or the other, but in shifting more towards intervals instead of continuous tempo I definitely notice that I'm lacking some aspects of mental toughness and pacing skills that the continuous tempo previously developed. I haven't raced a whole lot recently so I don't have a ton of experience here, but it's something I've noticed in training. Intuitively it seems like the solution to this would be either race into mental shape or throw in a few continuous tempos -for me throwing in a couple hilly continuous tempos toughened me up fairly well, though obviously thats a session that's antithetical to a lot of the training philosophy in this thread. For the marathon there is also fueling practice to consider, which is probably quite personal. As with anything else I'd say see if you can get good performance with the \"easier\" way to do stuff first (all short-moderate length intervals), and if you feel that some aspect of your ability is lacking extend the intervals or run some continuous tempo.",

    "message": "1. Not on my end. (Logged in from home, not signed in to my university or society accounts.) 2. Because the study reported the largest ever increase in mitochondrial marker enzyme activities ever observed in a longitudinal study (minimizing genetic advantages), to match the two-fold higher values found in elite athletes, despite the fact that the participants only trained 4 h/wk. (Apparently you've never encountered the classic 1964 paper in *Science* on \"strong inference\", one major point of which is that scientific progress is most rapid when you focus on *disproving* hypotheses.) 3. No one has said that larger volumes aren't necessary/beneficial - it is just to the extent that they are, *it's not because of some unique ability of \"zone 2\" training to alter muscle respiratory capacity\" as you have claimed*. 4. *Of course* the results are partially because the individuals were initially untrained. But, that's the whole point, because that is the reference condition when evaluating the muscle respiratory capacity of highly trained individuals. 5. There are numerous studies in the literature of both rats and humans showing a high correlation between mitochondrial enzyme activities and performance, mostly dating back to the late 1960s to early 1980s. For rats, see studies from Holloszy's lab. For humans, see Sjodin's work with marathoners. *However, this is really just a red herring. You claimed (and continue to claim) that when it comes to mitochondria/metabolism, there is something special about lower intensity, \"zone 2\" training. As that classic study by Gollnick et al. so aptly demonstrates, there isn't. You therefore need to find another way of rationalizing your belief system with respect to optimal training, because your hypothesis about being about mitochondria is flat-out wrong * 6. There is no LT1 or LT2, or really even an LT - lactate increases continually albeit not linearly as a function of intensity. The way to shift that curve is obviously to train with some combination of intensity and vi, but science can't tell you what is optimal, especially for any given individual. More importantly, focusing on attempting to improve physiological responses/adaptations is a mistake. What you should focus upon is improving actual *performance*, and just let the physiology sort itself out. Otherwise, you will find yourself going down stupid rabbit holes, like doing \"over-unders\" to try to improve lactate clearance (which is irrelevant), or obsessively measuring lactate concentrations during almost every workout, in the mistaken belief that \"intensity control\" is critical to improvement.",

The 90 min long run, even below 70% of MHR, depletes me. Wouldn’t I as a 5K runner get a bigger bang for my buck (and feel better, recover easier, higher overall TSS) doing a 60 min run instead, and coming back the next day with another sub-T session? The 30 minute continuous runs at around MP was brought up earlier in the thread but we never got a follow-up on that.

For me, this method has helped me improve. I didn't really even think one other person would be interested when I posted, let alone a year down the line I would be running times that have helped me qualify to run as an international master for my country. That's not a brag, it's just that even if someone came a long and said \"the science says you're an idiot\". I don't really care. FWIW I agree with Coggan in the sense that this training method is essentially sweetspot. I even said this sometime right near the start. I would also do more if I thought my body could handle it. But I don't think it can swing towards what I can handle on the bike. I still think 75/25 is the absolute most before you stray into injury territory. I don't think it's new in any real way, as Andrew will know it's a pretty common bang for buck approach for the UK time trial crew. A lot of what I picked up was originally shared by guys like Tarmacexpert on the TT forums, who I am sure Andrew is familiar with. Even old aged debates like 4x8mins versus 4x4, I've tried it all. This is just how I see the best risk free approach for cycling and running. I doubt I'll ever change or really mix it up. I think I've had half decent results for average talent in both sports. I just laid something out that I thought (I think has shown it does?) work for a large percentage of people who don't have a huge amount of time to train. That's not everyone by the way. There is no magic training etc . I also completely agree with AC on that. Is this the best way to train? ON 5-8 hours a week as runner? Maybe. Maybe not. If someone came along with another 100 page thread with even more success stories and someone who could show me the sustainability of being able to run day in, day out and not break down AND to get faster - I would just switch to that training system. Again, I really don't think there is anything magic about subthreshold or sweetspot, or literally whatever you want to call it. But I am as far away from a scientist or even someone who remotely understands what is going on under the hood. The spirit of this thread can be whatever people want it to be. For me, I just get up, go to work and do my own thing within the rough parameters I set out and hour a day and 90 mins on a Sunday. For others it's testing lactate. For others, the spirit of the thread might be just to try a slightly different training method to what a lot of running coaches might prescribe. To others, it might just be to strive to understand or get to the bottom of the science of it. The 30 min MP idea was kind of thrown around in the spirit of the thread, not to be taken seriously (when I posted it for instance) but then it might work. Who knows? I've tried to make Hard2find do it but he's doing some other madcap experiment of his instead 😂",

As I said, there is little scientific support for the common belief that individuals differ in terms of their stamina (i.e., resistance to fatigue during prolonged exercise). Once you account for \"threshold\", what little variation that exists between individuals (<10%, even when analyzing training, not racing, data from cyclists in the \"real world\", thus including additional noise from non-maximal, non-constant efforts) may very well just be due to measurement error, such that even just a 1% error in determining \"threshold\" will result in nearly a 10% difference in the duration that intensity can be maintained. Anyway, as the saying goes, claims require evidence, and extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. So, it's now up to you to demonstrate that 1) once you account for \"threshold\", stamina does indeed differ between individuals, and 2) explain the physiological mechanisms. (Note that I say all of the above despite having devised a mathematical model that includes stamina as one of the parameters. To quote Albert Korzybski: \"The map is not the territory.\")",

Progressed nicely really quicky at first, but just got to the point where the hard stuff was meaning I could never actually increase time on feet/ load. I just felt so beat up. I actually got a bit worse at the back end of 2022 as i was needing days off and was actually being able to run less. Absolutely just hit a brick wall. Nothing I could do would improve me. Running just because a chore. Didn't really think much into it, other than \"why don't I just try and train how I used to on the bike?\" With some of the obvious adaptations to running. I used to dread the long run, the easy runs, everything. A lot of it was just too fast looking back, comical in fact. No wonder I was so tired. When I switched to this, almost instantly I could increase my minutes slowly week by week, absolutely straight away. The brick wall I hit was knocked down. I then started to improve after about 6-8 weeks of the new regime and it's been a pretty steady increase chipping away month my month since. I was pretty annoyed with myself that I didn't go with my gut and just train this way from day 1. I wouldn't say I love running now, but it's no problem to get out there. I'm never so tired I think \"wow I can't run today\" as often happened, especially after the really hard days Daniels sometimes prescribes. There's always something in the tank for the next day now. I'm never running on fumes. IMO a Daniel's plan, if you have 6-10 weeks to get fit for something is a fantastic way to roll the dice and it'll likely work out, not worrying about what comes after. Past that or longer term goals, I don't think it's sustainable in the way that I have trained. Again, I'm not saying this is the only way to train or even the best. But it's probably the most likely way to get most people the consistency they need with enough work on limited hours, without falling apart, especially say if you have a goal 6+ months out. Most of the thread is filled with the same range of comments, not a lot happened then progressively after a couple of months they started to really build into some good fitness, a lot they haven't seen before. I might have improved and found a way to adapt Daniels, but there is no way I would be sitting at 15:40/32:23 at 40 years old. This consistency has absolutely scraped every ounce of the average talent I have out. Much as it did on the bike. I was also way over achieving there for the average talent I had. But found a way to squeeze every last drop. But, as easy as it sounds, it's been a long, long grind and quite boring at times. The feedback I can give and the feedback so many others have told me, is that you can sustain this. No peaks, no ups and downs, just a slow burn in a pretty safe and manageable manner. The other thing, whilst injury's obviously still occur but the general feeling is this reduces the risk of injury to the lower end of the spectrum for runners. I think that's also a big factor in why this is a good idea, especially for us older runners.",

If disco and bell bottom jeans are the vibe… David Costill, Jack Daniels, et al. have a 1976 study where they sampled higher level athletes from a variety of disciplines. I’ll speak specifically to the male data in the study, sprinters (100m) had a mean SDH of 12.9 and 24% area ST fibers, mid-distance runners (800m) had mean SDH of 14.8 and 47% area ST fibers, and distance runners (5000m+) had a mean SDH of 16.6 and 62% area ST fibers. For reference, the untrained subjects in their study had an SDH of 7.4 and 56% area ST fibers. So, saying the study you linked resulted in the participants reaching near elite runner status, seems a misrepresentation of elite. Or to draw from one of your earlier comments, it would be akin to equating a sport scientist to an exercise physiologist. Regardless, for every 6 person study that exists to draw overarching conclusions in exercise physiology, there is usually an equally underrepresented population sample to show the opposite, or at least question the aesthetic sense of anyone who thinks 1970’s avocado green paired with floral patterns should remain the preferred kitchen design of the 2020’s… David Bishop has research that shows mitochondrial content (i.e. volume) may be more influenced by duration, where as mitochondrial function (i.e. respiratory capacity) may be more influenced by intensity. And that inferring increases in mitochondrial function from increases in certain mitochondrial enzyme activity, may not be as valid as previously thought. I think the aforementioned is what John Whelan had in mind when suggesting a longer run still has a place in the training plan. P.S. I can assure any of those actually interested, it won't cost you $25 to access this paper... just a waste of your Saturday haha",

You vs Lexel is a much more entertaining matchup and I don't want to distract from that anymore, and my apologizes to both you and Lexel for the accusation that you are the same person. If the the cell metabolism is shifted at lower intensities, why wouldn't the training signals at this level be shifted as well? Why wouldn't there be unique benefits to these different signals, particularly with how they pertain to general health and the ability to adapt to training in general? If nothing else I would think there would be some specific benefit of working at lower intensity for developing the capacity to transport fatty acyl-CoA into the mitochondria. More access to fat metabolism should provide more energy for training and recovery. Even if any \"uniqueness\" of benefit is purely due to volume/duration isn't that practically the same because the volume/duration is only achievable with lower intensity? I'm under the impression that we still don't have a super clear concept about if and what different stimuli increase the surface area of mitochondria vs the enzymes in them, but that long and easy has been shown to be good for expanding that surface area, while shorter and harder is best for increasing the enzymes. It obviously was a mistake to have worded my original point as a statement rather than the question/hypothesis that it really is, but I'll stand by that it's a reasonable concept. If it's not a reasonable concept certainly someone as knowledgable as yourself would have a much easier time explaining why not. Gollnick et al. aren't really concerned about fat metabolism in that study or anything related to metabolic flexibility. They're just looking at fiber types, glycogen, aerobic capacity vis SDH, and anaerobic capacity using PFK. SDH activity is obviously important for metabolic flexibility, but since it's a few steps downstream of where the fuel is coming into the TCA cycle it doesn't seem like a good enough proxy to me. They also don't measure mitochondria volume. When it comes to SDH they explain that they made deliberate choices to try to get the biggest effect on SDH activity -the VL muscle and an activity (cycling) that demands extensive use of this muscle. They explain that the SDH activity in the subjects is greater than what they measured in runners because cycling demands more from the VL, yet the VO2max/kg is still greater with the runners -to me this seems like they're saying it was deliberately meant to just be a small snapshot of whats going so that they could get a very large effect. It's proof of concept demonstration, but nowhere a full measure of whats going on in the mitochondria or any sort of sport-specific metabolic output. I feel you are exaggerating what this demonstrates, particularly in a comparison to runners, when the authors themselves seem to say that isn't a fair comparison. With this I of course do have to eat some sci-hub crow -I probably don't have higher SDH activity in my VL muscle than the participants in the study. I seem to be in alight company there, as from another Gollnick study we can see that Dan Murphy (4th at 1971 NCAA XC) had a lower VL SDH than the average of those six guys at the end of their bike erg training. Like you said we should focus on performance rather than physiological responses. I know that LT1 and LT2 (or any other way to slice up intensities) are not really true physiological anchor points/events/whatever, but they are still useful estimates for how metabolism is changing in response to intensity.",

    "message": "Clearly you also need to improve your ability to understand and interpret the scientific literature... The measured activity of an enzyme is obviously dependent on numerous factors, e.g., the concentrations of substrates and co-factors, pH, temperature, etc. You therefore really can't compare absolute values across studies/laboratories as you have done - indeed, even within a laboratory there can be \"drift\" in the measurements over time, due to, e.g., different individuals preparing standards with vary technique/accuracy. (This is why we use NIST-traceable standards when measuring nitrate and nitrite concentrations via HPLC.) Because of the above, you should really only compare relative values/changes. In that regard, even the distance runners in Costill et al.'s classic study had an SDH activity only slightly more than twice that of the untrained controls, similar to the magnitude of the increase observed in Gollnick's study. This, despite large differences in training volume and, of course, genetics (including fiber type differences). As for Bishop, what he has is a(n) hypothesis...others such as Martin Gibala would obviously disagree.",

    "message": "There you go again, repeating/reinforcing myths/hypotheses as if they are established facts... Re. intensity: the first thing that you have to realize is that the word doesn't mean much at the level of an individual motor units/single muscle fiber. That is, by and large that motor unit is either recruited and those muscle fibers are activated, or they aren't. (Obviously rate-coding can layered on top of this, although that is a motor control strategy that seems to reserved for only short bursts of activity, not sustained exercise.) Furthermore, since the primary signals driving the muscular adaptations to training (i.e., cellular energetics, calcium, and *perhaps* glycogen availability) are all intracellular, a given muscle fiber really doesn't know or care what its neighbors are doing, or what the humoral/hormonal milleu might be). If this were *not* true, then you would find adaptations in muscle fibers/motor units and even muscles not engaged in the exercise - yet you don't, i.e., the adaptations are local. Furthermore, you can eliminate the influence of hormones using surgical approaches, drugs to block receptors, etc., yet the muscle still adapts as expected. As for fat metabolism, it is a red herring. That is, you don't have to oxidize fat to get better at oxidizing fat, and increased rates of fat oxidation are not responsible for the training induced increase in muscle mitochondria. Finally , the whole \"train long for mitochondrial quantity, train hard for mitochondrial quality\" idea is belief by the dynamic nature of the mitochondrial reticulum, as I described previously.",

(the PR was in a big parking lot so I take it with a grain of salt if maybe GPS tricked me. But either way, I definitely PRd with quite some margin) -I’m 38, running for a bit over a year now while having a 10 hour job and a 18 month old daughter. -running got really important for me but obviously ranked behind family and work which I need to feed my family 😂 -the 2 PRs had 5 months inbetween, I don’t know if that’s good or bad, just a fact -it took some months to really feel the improvements where I also feel like I made a huge jump last 4 weeks out of nowhere (stuff like easy pace going down 20 seconds at same hr <70% within what felt like from one day to another) So my thoughts are not about a random PR where most will laugh about the time, it’s more about a method which is suitable for time limited people like me who still want to be in shape and get their „best bang for the buck“ (it’s not like I wouldn’t care about progress, I really do care but only vs myself) I just can say that I’m able to run 7 days a week (I do the exact plan laid out on page 1) with around 75-90km a week without needing a single rest day last 6 months cause of being tired. The only times i made a break was illness. I also didn’t have any injury. Another great thing for me is that I don’t need to think about what I „need“ to do the next day or if I’m able to hit my peak workout paces that day. I just put my 3 pre set workouts (10*3min, 5*6min, or 3*10min) on my watch and press start. With a lot of stuff around running I’m also not in the same shape every day (sometimes 5 hours of sleep-sometimes 8, sometimes bad hydrated and whatever else life brings) so I obviously have days where my paces feel super easy and others where it doesn’t. But on all days it’s „easy“ enough that I’m recovered enough to go again 2 days later. (1 misconception is often that it’s super easy, it’s still work to do 3 times a week) That also leads to not overthinking things like I would tend to do (hitting a bad workout which was a „key one“ would make me overthink it, with this method I’m also not happy if I had a bad one but I just go again 2 days later) Long story short: i know that my personal progress can have different reasons (especially with only running for that short time) ,but I’ve learned that consistency is probably one of the main things to get better at running. This method allows me to be as consistent as I probably could be (1.500km as per today for the year) without burning out or being injured. This thread and especially the community on Strava helped me tremendously understanding a bit more what I do(sub 2:40 marathoners and sub 16 5k guys take time out of their day to help random Internet guys like me getting better) I didn’t wanted to interrupt the conversation about different studies, stuff I don’t know any about or don’t want to follow exactly, but maybe I was able to help a person like me (hobby jogger who didn’t knew what to do exactly) to give this method a go. shoutout to all the legends in this thread like sirpoc, hard2find, shirtboy, jiggy etc (I forgot names of some more guys so sorry for that) to help out other people like me with their enormous knowledge for free!!!",

Differences between individuals (generally invisible to the naked eye) explain only a tiny fraction of differences between individuals in the energy cost of running. Furthermore, while gait retraining is possible, altering an individuals natural running form generally leads to an increase, not a decrease in energy cost. Those who think that they can coach running form (\"Pick your knees up!\" \"Stop over striding!\" \"Drive off your toes!\" Etc.) are just fooling themselves. (Even in the far more technique dependent sport of swimming, people have come to realize that self-optimization has a significant influence. Instead of trying to alter basic stroke mechanics of long term swimmers, the focus is on things like how many dolphin kicks to take off the wall.)",

Did 9 sets of 2 on, 1 off yesterday due to a time crunch. Went by feel--7:15-7:20-ish and it felt easy. Legs were not cooked at all the day after.",

    "message": "So I’ve been using this method since September. Previous PB was 20:40z Started out getting a 19:25 PB after 4 weeks and then a 18:30 8 weeks later. Around the end of December did I 18:05 and then sadly got injured. Jumped on the bike for 6 weeks and simply followed the same schedule and added some more volume. When my foot felt good again I started jogging and did a couple of small sessions before doing Paris half in 1:27 after 2 weeks of running. Started training seriously with this method again mid march. This time more conservative and without the need to push more volume around threshold and easy but just keep it at the same and see how I develop. I also started running everyday instead of squeezing it in to 6 days. My body feels better and I’m always ready to go. Averaging around 6 hours a week or 70-75k without missing a day the last 12 weeks. Did a Parkrun on a slower gravel course than my usual TT loop and ran 17:50 one month ago. Signed up for a 5000m on the track and did a 17:11 this Tuesday finishing with a 3:21/km last K! Very surprised and on my way to sub 17 which I never thought would be possible for me. This clearly is working. The nature of this approach is repetitive but I love that I know what I have to do on a given day and that I always can squeeze it in no matter my schedule. My body never gets shocked with a crazy workout or long run and therefore I can stay injury free. The 7 vs 6 days and the very slow progression of volume compared to my last attempt that ended up in injury seems to make all the difference. For anyone interested schedule is now: 3x45 easy 3x10 4x6 10x3 80 easy Rinse & repeat. 4 weeks ago I added 2 repeats to the 3 minute reps. 5 min to each easy over the course of 3 weeks. Very slow progression. I follow my CTL and update paces etc. using intervals.icu tl;dr Just do the same as sirpoc and get some pbs",

Rather, he thought that prior studies reporting no increase in response to training were simply due to an inadequate training stimulus. As research has repeatedly shown, he was correct: intensity is as, if not more, important as a driver of such adaptation, and the more well-trained you are, the harder you have to train to induce further improvement.)",

Clearly if you left out the T sessions you wouldn't be improving at all unless you were a complete newbie. Everyone and their mother does Easy days - there's even entire programs built around them 'easy intervals' for example and for the most part they all SUCK. T sessions are what drives the improvement. Easy days are there primarily for RECOVERY from the T sessions - if you didnt need to recover you could just do T sessions every day. And ramping up mileage and/or speed on easy days is only slowing down the recovery process. Why this is not plain as day is beyond me but whatever. There are two guys right in a row a few pages up who are using Thresh training with basically NO easy days - they literally do NOTHING on those days - and getting the SAME type of success as Sirpoc. All that does is completely validate my point that easy days are no where near as critical as most think - especially high mileage easy days. That's not laziness or short-cutting - it's using the brains God gave u for something other than supporting your hat. In any case - I don't see a lot of evidence in the strava group that ANYONE is using this training other than Sirpoc. I looked at almost all of the top 100 non-private runners and checked their training and only found Sirpoc and maybe 2 or 3 other guys actually doing even a version of what he is doing. 98 percent of the strava group either does zero T sessions - or they do completely conventional training with one T session thrown in randomly every week or two.",

Road races just weren't a thing at the time (1970s) However, in my mid-30s, after racing bikes for over two decades, I dabbled in duathlons a bit, and ran a bunch of them. I don't recall my exact PB, but it was around 17:15. As you might imagine, in duathlons I would fall way behind during the first run, blast through the field on the bike, then do my best to hold on during the second run. I did ok - top amateur at a world cup race, one step off the podium at age-group worlds, etc. - but I wasn't nearly as good as folks like my friend Phil Ponebshek, who could throw down a 15 flat, not give up a huge amount of time to me on the bike, then back it up with a 15:15 or so. Interestingly, our physiological characteristics - VO2max, threshold, fiber type - were nearly identical, but his running economy was decent, whereas I required 40% (initially) to 20% (after duathloning for a year) more energy to run at a given speed than even an untrained runner. ETA: Phil ran for Princeton. I don't know his 5 km PB, but he was better at longer distances anyway...2:20 for the marathon (when the trials cut was 2:18).",

I actually appreciate what you have brought to the thread this far, and I think most people could agree with some, if not most of your points if you presented them from a place of mutual curiosity rather than superiority. Your point about specificity and mitochondrial biogenesis is intuitive, as it doesn’t make sense for someone to get better at running by walking (extreme example). I wonder though, are there actually a few “magic” points in intensity that have a disproportionate benefit compared to other intensity levels. Would it not make sense that the point lactate starts rising above resting levels (LT1?) be one of these? What about the point right before time to failure starts increasing rapidly disproportionately to velocity (around LT2)? Another question is the scale that running adaptations happen on. Do the majority take place on a local scale (in the muscle, mitochondria) or a global scale (cardio). The answer to this question decides how effective cross training is, particularly with modalities that don’t utilize running specific muscles.",

    "message": "It's very challenging to comprehensively study whats going on in the mitochondria in response to exercise, so keep in mind when most studies talk about any aspect of mitochondrial function, volume, whatever, they are often just looking at some of proxy for these in a form of a particular mitochondrial enzyme or membrane protein. When it comes to the idea that too much quality running and not enough easy running leads to mitochondrial damage there's some evidence that could support this and a few working models of what's going on, but nothing super solid to my knowledge. A ramble on a few concepts: One theory is that too much intense exercise leads to an overproduction of reactive oxygen species overwhelms the antioxidative capacity of the mitochondria to deal with these ROS. I'm not sure if the result here is actual damage to the mitochondria or just a compensatory shutdown of metabolism (and thus production of ROS) so that they can get back to a more balanced redox environment. Another possibility is an imbalance in substrate utilization with too much intensity. I seem to recall some studies that have found disturbed glucose control and insulin sensitivity issues in elite athletes training very hard. Not sure of the exact implications here. Another theory is less about dose/damage of high intensity itself and more about what we're not doing during this type of training. If we drop overall volume and threshold work we just lose aerobic capacity over time -pretty simple. I like to think of the mitochondria less as machine-like powerhouses that we should constantly push to the limit, and more like microscopic livestock that we need to cultivate and take care of. Training serves to \"feed\" them. We need to feed them the right balance of stuff and should not abuse them. Not the best analogy but I think there's something here. I'm not sure if easy running is actively \"protective\" against mitochondrial damage/dysregulation or if its more just a general balancing of training effects. That being said, a short easy run is a nice boost of hormones and blood flow that aids in recovery and adaptation. For a high volume athlete who is very fit and very durable they can add in a daily jog to get these recovery benefits without a recovery cost. For a normal runner something like an easy walk or bike ride in the morning would probably get the job done and be safer. Going into less understood and maybe somewhat woo woo territory now, I think an important aspect of successful training is not only getting the correct training load, but balancing time between heightened, ready-to-perform, sympathetic nervous system state and the chill rebuild parasympathetic nervous system state. If we are doing much intensity we are always in ready-to-perform mode and not getting to fully rebuild from all that stress. Easy running gets/keeps us in that chill mode where actual adaptation takes place. There's plenty more models/theories/whatever about this, and ultimately not sure it really matters how we describe whats going on in the mitochondria. We have a pretty good idea of what works from all the coaches and athletes running real world experiments. The best consistently run a lot and run most that fairly easy. I don't think we need to a deep understanding of cellular biology to tell us to follow the obvious path here.",

To bring it back to the thread overall, like your point, we don't necessarily need to know the stuff sirpoc has laid out works - and workings to a high ish level, all we need to know is it seems to work for a large and significant majority for those who have tried it. This isn't hearsay, there's countless real people who have posted her and on Strava who have tried this for a significant period of time. My personal view is that it is a clever mix and balance of the hardest higher intensity stuff one can handle + plenty of easy running. This provides a backdrop and consistency so many runners have never had, using more traditional methods. Of course, as others have said this isn't a magic pill. But it is most likely , if you can stick to it, going to provide improvement to most runners on some sort of time crunched and limited schedule.

Considering nobody runs in school apart from the days you are made to do it on cold, winters days, it's a pretty good indicator of who the natural talented kids are as he's mentioned. In fact, I know there's a lot of talent spotting UK athletics does at stuff like this. It's a really good indicator of who might be aerobically talented, or will become it. As 90% of kids are just footballers at this point. He's mentioned this before and I totally understand the point. 2. If he was really talented, in my opinion he would have gotten much better results out of Daniels. Really talented guys seem to flourish even with just a bit of work with a Daniel's system. They definitely don't \"peak\" or plateau at 19, if you have talent. The system seems to have been how he's managed to break through the barrier, a lot of good runners hit, but never reach even nearly 90% of their true potential as they really need to train to get near it or just can't manage the load. A really talented runner in my eyes would be running even 17:30 minimum on a Daniel's plan he followed after even just 6 months. Let alone over a year just to get 18:50. Also I believe he posted his FTP was 315 on the bike. Honestly, I hope he doesn't take this with disrespect. But that's not really talented in the slightest to be honest. Just my thoughts on the subject, but it's something interesting for sure to think about. What talent even is. Anyway, congrats to him on another PB. Well earned and I think a great inspiration to many of us older runners.",

They might not even know they have talent and are being held back by the regime if they are later to running as well. Let's say fiber types matters, for argument sake and they are also slow twitch like sirpoc. There might be a lot of other guys in the same situation with literally minutes more talent to unlock.

Picked up a Daniels book and was at 17:30 in less than a year. But then I hit a plateau like sirpoc describes. Unlike sirpoc, I stuck with Daniels. I wish I would have had the insight he had to switch methods because the threshold system is definitely superior. But I stuck with Daniels and it wasn’t until 3 years later that I was running in the 16s for 5K. The implication, if we take sirpoc’s results at face value (18–> 15), seems to be that I would have been able to run well into the 15s if not the 14s in my 20s using the Norwegian singles approach. But is the difference really that much? Maybe the difference is worth 1-2 minutes over 5K, tops. Maybe sirpoc spends a few more years training under Daniels and gets down to low 17s/high 16s and then truly plateaus. Thoughts?",

    "message": "Cases could be made for either, ultimately comes down to the specifics of what someone's training looks like and what their preferences are. Like a lot of this thread sometimes people get lost looking for hard rules when they really just need to use common sense and listen to their body. A case for doubling on the easy days is that the split here can keep each easy run truly easy, and you get a double dose of the blood flow, hormone boost, etc that helps you recover and adapt. There's a point of trying to scale up individual easy run duration where it becomes not so easy. Think about that point in duration where your legs start to feel heavy and it requires relatively more mental energy to keep going -one idea behind splitting the easy day into a double is that it helps manage exposure to that while still getting in a lot of volume. One key aspect of this thread is managing day-to-day effort so that there aren't huge swings in training and we can keep overall training load higher by virtue of that. Hard-days-hard and easy-days-easy is a useful heuristic for beginners that often gets overdone because people don't understand the overall goals of training. These threshold sessions can accumulate a lot of volume so adding an easy double to that day can push the daily volume way too far into \"hard\" for some people. Again it kinda depends on where the individual is at with their total volume and how they response to different sessions. For example: I'm in a situation right now where my easy days are about ~100min of running, split roughly evenly between two runs and my threshold sessions accumulate 70-80min of total running. Adding a double to that pushes it towards 100-120min total on the day, which is sometimes fine, but sometimes leaves me asking a little too much of the next easy day recovery wise. Particularly with the summer heat its a judgement call where sometimes I drop the double on my hard days and they end up being less total volume than my easy days. I'm pretty close to getting fit enough where the extra volume of doubling every workout and easy day will no longer be issue, but in this sort of transitory level of training I go against the common convention some days in favor of the overall training load. As I continue to scale up volume I will focus most of that additional volume on workout days and my training will start to look more \"conventional\" in that sense. Be confident in running your own experiment and figuring out what makes sense for your current level.",

I think just the volume of it would leave me feeling slightly tired during the workout the day after. For this reason I'm going to experiment with 30 min doubles on 1 or 2 of the sub T days and just keep the easy days 60 min and 1 90 min lr per week. I have only been running a total of ~3 years so far and am currently hovering around 45 mpw with a max of 60 mpw for a few weeks last summer, so I don't want to overdo it.

    "message": "This will be a longer post, but I wanted to relay my experience using this method for a 9 week marathon build. For context I am 26m, 17:12 5k, 36:15 10k, and 1:20 half. I stagnated late last year and only improved my 5k from 17:27>17:12, but I know I have faster times in me. Races on the calendar this year for me are Grandmas Marathon (6/22) and The Bear 100M (9/27). Originally I was thinking 2:45ish should be possible for the marathon, and 22 hours for the Bear. Fast forward to February where I got a stress fracture in one of my metatarsals on my left foot which left me unable to run until 4/24. I built from 10 miles to 64 in the last two weeks using the method outlined here. My weekly schedule looked like this M - easy, T - shorter reps (25x400, 10x1K), W - Easy, Th - MLR of 10-12 miles with longer reps (5x2k, 3x2mi), F- Easy, Sat - LR of 16-19 miles with 15-20K of work typically descending ladder of 2x5k, 3k, 2k or some version of that, sun - Easy bike. Things were starting to click and I was feeling so good in training that I almost didn't want to taper for the marathon given my half baked training leading in. I ended up running 2:55 and hitting a huge wall at mile 20. I was moderately happy with the result given the hiccups in the build, but at the same time it's hard for me not to think I have a lot more left in me. I am wondering whether people here think that I would have needed a more traditional buildup with more mileage to build the strength necessary for the marathon, or if what I was lacking was more straight MP runs like Pfitz or Daniels would prescribe? Next, I am probably the first here to try and apply this training to a 100M ultramarathon where I will have a proper 16 week build. My plan here is going to be double subthreshold sessions on Tuesday and Thursday consisting of 10x1k, or 5x2k in the morning and a 30 minute uphill treadmill session at lunch (probably more like upper Z2 at 15% grade). I am wondering if anyone has thoughts here on how best to apply this to a mountain ultra. I do believe that I am getting very good results using this method and feel like I would be leaving something on the table training wise if I used the traditional ultra training that is exclusively slogging out long slow miles in the mountains (which I will do some of).

    "message": "Most on this thread have more experience than me but here are my thoughts. Was this your first marathon? If so great work! The longer the distances, the less predictive the calculators are. Sounds like you got the most out of the day. Most people slow in the last 6 miles so that's pretty normal. Hard2find and others, correct me if I'm wrong, but the pace calculators are based on a rough prediction that as the distance doubles the race pace slows about 5%. If you're aerobically well trained that holds well, except it's VERY challenging to have your MP pace just 5% slower than HMP, so the model fails for many. Not sure if you're familiar with Nate Jenkins but he's great to listen to about this. I believe he had a podcast with the poster who did the summary of this method (I recognized his voice but I think the podcast was under a different channel name). Nate thinks that highly specific marathon training from coaches like Canova is why many of the East African athletes compete well in the marathon (5% slow down) while many pros in the US can struggle to get 10-15% slow down. The specific work is needed to extend your existing fitness. That said, if Canova was coaching a hobby jogger like you or me I'm not sure he would do that much differently than this method? One way Canova thinks of it is that the base phase has little amplitude between sessions and high global volume. The specific phase is the opposite, huge sessions with very little in between, global volume is not the top priority. I'm of the opinion that the highly specific work is more appropriate for the elites who are already operating, and have been for a while, at their maximal sustainable load. Canova may think the same. If all elites are practically at their maximal sustainable load, specificity becomes the difference maker. Specificity is like improving the wheels of a car. With better wheels you can hold up better and be more efficient within your aerobic limits. For us hobby joggers the aerobic conditioning (car engine) is the biggest determiner- the car not the wheels. You do still need enough of a long run to handle the distance, but not so much that it compromises global load. About the MP block runs. I messaged Nate Jenkins on Strava a while back to see if he would give me feedback on my Canova/ Nate Jenkins inspired marathon plan. He was nice enough to take a look at it and send his feedback. I had 8,10,12, and 14 miles of straight MP tempos in the plan spread out over 12 weeks or so. His advice was to cut those into intervals and have float recoveries at 90% MP. Very similar to the ethos of this thread, his experience is that you get the stimulus and volume without the extra fatigue. This is coming from one of the hardest working and toughest runners around, so if the straight tempos made a difference that's certainly what he would advocate. People following this approach wouldn't do as much in one session, I am just giving this as an example of the straight tempo vs intervals decision. So I think your suspicions are right, you just need more time accumulating load. Just don't get injured and stay consistent. Regarding your ultra, is this your first one? If it's your first ultra, maybe do a few shorter ones first? I've done a few 50ks and a 50 miler--they are tough! For training, my suggestion would be to settle in to your maximal sustainable load akin to what others are doing on this thread and what you have already done and every 3-4 weeks do a big adventure run. 30+ miles or back to backs. So much of ultras is getting the logistics figured out, hydration, nutrition, chafing, etc and you can only do that by doing it. It may be too much too soon to jump to doubles on your quality days. Like others have suggested, it may be wise to schedule doubles on your easy days (if doubles are needed at all), and only after you know how you respond to that add in the extra load on the quality days. My other suggestion would be to drop the time goal. Just finish (survive)! I have friends who want me to do a hundred miler with them and I think they're nuts. That's so much suffering. Finishing would be an incredible achievement! You can always come back next year and try to beat your time.",

He is certainly an animal. Regarding the ultras I have done 3 50s and a 50k, my best performance being an 8:50 50 mile with ~11k of climbing. I have always thought I was better the longer an event goes, and was shocked at how hard the marathon was at the end. I am comfortable doubling on easy days and have been incorporating 60/30 doubles on my those days without excess fatigue. I will ease into this build but I will at least try the double workout days and report back on how that goes. It seems like 30 minutes climbing at 15% and 12-13 minute pace will not effect my legs too much, the variable will be the aerobic load. I am planning on doing enough volume to support this, and I keep a few hours of very easy cycling (100-110 bpm) in my week to balance things out further. Regarding the time goal, yes I will likely drop this, its better for me to go into a race without expectations and not trying to hit rigid time splits. Thank you for the advice!",

    "message": "This is where you have let yourself be totally confused by the nonsense JS has posted. There is no thhreshold pace here. That's the point. It's a threshold state. It's all about what paces for sirpoc have created the desired lactate. That can be 12-15k pace for 1k reps or 20-30k pace for 3.2k reps. The pace is varied, the sun threshold state is the same. It's pretty key to read the whole thread to understand all this in terms of an overall concept. If you look at recent races, sirpoc LTHR I would guess is around 178-180. You can see he's almost never working at this level. Maybe I've seen him post on Strava he busted a workout , even then he's maybe touched LTHR maybe for a couple of mins, on the last rep. Even then of course, HR is only telling a small part of the picture. If you don't understand this concept (like coach JS, clearly) then probably it's not worth doing this method of training, as you'll likely mess it up. One thing for sure, this is probably actually more complicated for some people to understand than you'd think. In general, I think it fair to say a large but significantly minority are simply not understanding about what sub threshold actually is or what is trying to be achieved here.",

    "message": "Once again some people are getting lost in the weeds here, this time with LTHR. Keep in mind that LTHR is nowhere near a clean cut physiological variable that some of ya'll are trying to make it -it's a proxy of a proxy for the thing we actually care about, and there are a variety of different definitions and methods for determining it. Will LTHR change much in response to training? That depends on a few things. How developed is the athlete? How are they determining LTHR? With a relatively untrained athlete it could change a lot. With a highly trained athlete probably not so much. It may also \"change\" as a reflection of getting better at executing the method used to determine it. I'm a fairly experienced runner of reasonably high ability, but I've never done a Friel LTHR test, so if you had me go out and do that right now there's decent odds I don't get it perfect the first couple attempts -out of context it may look like I improved my LTHR, but really I probably would just poorly pace the first couple attempts. What I'm trying to get at is that speaking to this concept broadly across individuals is impossible and useless. What actually matters With sirpoc (or any other anecdote of success) the utility of analyzing their numbers is only to understand the framework such that you can take that and run your own experiment, you probably don't want to get too caught up the numbers themselves. The framework here with how it relates to LTHR is that you should mostly stay under your estimation of strict LT so you can do more of it throughout the week and repeat that week after week. This is accomplished through a balance of taking it slightly easier and the interval scheme itself simply reducing the accumulation of stress. Certain interval schemes with allow for an instantaneous effort that is harder than strict LT pace/effort, but the breaks keep the cumulative stress across the workout below strict LT.",

In his first race his cadence was about 201 ave, 210 for the last 2. So as he got faster he just increased his cadence (maybe stride at the same time - can't tell from the data), lately it seems his cadence is pretty locked so his stride must be a bit longer. So a 35+ second drop per mile in pace over a year in his 10k times and the HR has not moved an inch. He is a great guy to check data on because he is so damn consistent and racing where he does everything is sea level flat and almost same weather.",

Crazy difference there. Recently tho his HR has climbed to 174 at the end of reps. That could just be summer heat maybe. So pick the middle and use 168 / 0.845 = 199 MHR Personally I think MHR is a relatively useless number in the sense u never see it in real life unless you are wearing a smartwatch while running up a mountainside from some slasher trying to kill u while taking cocaine or something. LTHR is the most important HR number and since Sirpocs race HR has not changed have to assume LTHR has not changed either. 175. Note the 174 above.",

Which leads to pace/power as the best control option during a rep. How do you feel the next day is important, you can do lactate testing after the last rep, or check the avg HR of the last min of the last rep (not so optimal but better than nothing) to adjust for the next quality session.

Last year I ran a 1:22 HM, 1:04 for 10 miles, and 18:30 for 5K, to give a ballpark range of fitness. I've got a 5K coming up in 2 days. I'm going to give this method a serious try for a lot of reasons. It's a good fit for my best distances (10K-HM); I'm not much of a miler or marathoner. It's a good fit for who I am (a slow twitch, time constrained hobby jogger). I like the idea of trying to adapt elite training - I once tried to adapt Canova for hobby joggers, with pretty good results (I have a post about it somewhere). I have no marathon plans in the near future. The weather here ranges from awful to life-threatening for 3-5 months of the year, so a lot of my winter running is on an indoor track where intervals can help keep things interesting. And after 2 weeks, I'm loving it. After the marathon I took a week completely off, did light jogging for a week, and then tried to do 3 sub-threshold workouts. I started off with 6x400, then added a bit of volume each time. After 2 weeks I'm up to 3 miles of volume, 3 times per week, plus easy mileage for a total of 40-45 miles per week so far. This is the first time I've been able to hit 3 workouts a week - I tried it once with Daniels but had to back off. I'm finishing the workouts feeling refreshed and looking forward to the next one, not dreading the pain to come or worried about blowing up. Sirpoc's descriptions back in the first few pages and then more recently - he'll finish a session feeling like he's done a workout, but ready to go again - have been really useful for me. My workout paces are probably all on the slow side, from maybe 5 seconds faster than marathon pace to 1 hour/15K pace at the fastest (so 6:25-6:40/mile, approximately). I take it by feel and try to keep everything in control. I'm keeping easy days easy and lot letting them turn into uptempo steady pace runs. If 3 x 3 miles total at HMP as cruise intervals per week doesn't sound like much, keep in mind that it's (so far) 100% sustainable. My recent marathon buildup was a mess due to weather and minor injury/illness and family emergencies, so I would do a big workout, then have to recover with a long stretch of easy running. Lots of modulation between major efforts and recovery days. The reality is that in my buildup since January, I only averaged 6 miles of workout volume per week, mostly at MP. So a couple weeks in, just doing basic workouts, I'm already 50% above that in terms of workout volume, and at a faster pace. I'm planning to hold here for a while, then build to 4 miles of workout volume in August/September. We'll see how it goes, but it seems very doable right now. At 4 miles of volume, 3 workouts a week would give me as much consistent training load as 2 workouts a week with 6 miles, which seems a lot harder. I feel like I detrain quickly - I definitely notice it if I take 2 days off in a row - and the schedule that gives me a stimulus of faster running basically every other day seems to have some benefits over one big workout every week or two. And at 3 x 4 miles per week, I'll still have lots of room to progress over the winter. I have to adapt the program slightly. I'm using a subjective mix of pace, HR and RPE to guide me. I have to add 5-6 surges/strides to my warm-up, progressing up to MP, just so I can get on pace for the first rep; I'm old, and trying to roll straight into MP doesn't go well. And I only run 6 days per week. I've tried E-St-E-St-E-St and mixing the St repeats into the longer E run. Eventually I'll see if I can do St-E-St-E-St-Long. I'll be back with results eventually, and random contributions before then.",

Saturday is fun day. As a more \"FT distance runner\" I have experimented with more sub threshold or tempo volume per workout. It came out that I can sustain well about 3 miles sub threshold per workout and 3 workouts per week. I do know longer tempo stuff very well. All the other classic training methods as well. More frequently higher intensity or longer tempos are too tyring for me. I want to have quick feets nearly every day. Fast running is my main fun. However, due to frequent worldwide business travels I have some breaks which makes it difficult to string together many weeks of uninterrupted training. Trying to stay under 5 off-days per month. I never race or seriously time-trial. I want to conserve my nervous energy for other life and work stuff. I assume me at 19:30 min fitness for 5k without any taper. Have fun",

Felt strong and controlled throughout--I didn't go out super fast--let everyone pass me early on--for fear of dying to 7:40 splits. My goal was to run negative splits. It sucked 2.5 miles in, which is normal for a 5k and I had to hang on until the end. I wish I had a better kick but to be fair it was not an A race, just a fitness check to see where I am at in my training (marathon build plus just general fitness). I also haven't practiced kicking in a race like this either. That HR (Garmin Fenix 5S, a good watch and not cheap), was WAY low. I would think I'd have it around 190-200 at 5k effort (which it was). I know wrist monitors are not 100% accurate but if it was something like 175-180 (instead of 190) for 5k that would make more sense. But 152-155 is tempo pace...

I know it's easy to say \"who cares\" and that's a good point but I take threading seriously and if I am failing I want to know where in order to improve and get better. I try to put 100% in everything I do in life, and take failure hard. I'll just refrain from asking dumb questions and re-read the threshold thread from page 1. I wish there was a way to search within a given thread for a keyword, for instance. That would clarify things w/o having to ask the same question again (even by accident, I can see how it would annoy others). Re: pace I've found that just varying the sub-threshold pace-by-time also helps--i.e. if you're able to do 3x10 one day but only 2x7 48 hours later that will still give you *some* residual effect, even if it's not the same as doing 3x10, EZ, 3x10, EZ, etc. That way you can fit it into your schedule to some degree...if not perfectly.",

You should definitely run a race every so often to keep in touch with the hard effort as well as to check your fitness and potentially adjust your threshold. 10x3min for you is going to give very close to 50 TSS. If it is truly sub T then it will be just under 50. I would estimate your threshold from your 5km to be around 6:07/mi, so 6:10/mi would be 99% of Threshold. This would give around 49 TSS. Your 17:40 5km would be 1060 seconds at 108% of threshold. That would give 34-35 TSS.",

You definitely need to cross LT2 though -the way LT2 is estimated on a lactate curve is by the change in slope that occurs at LT2 so a couple steps above LT2 are absolutely required to make this curve and have accurate paces. Some general guidelines for crafting your own protocol: I recently did the following test and feel like it worked out pretty well for me, even with me botching the pacing on step #1 and failing to complete the final step. Currently at low 15min 5k ability running 110-135km/week Got pretty clean data despite a couple mistakes, but better pacing and getting an extra data point below AeT/LT1 would have been helpful. To get LT1 we're looking for that first change in slope from baseline, so we need to establish baseline accurately. I'll also point out that the pace estimates I got from this test where exactly the same as those I had already been using based on a combination of VDOT and breathing guesstimates. The lactate testing is a fun exercise and good confirmation, but by itself is probably not going to revolutionize anybody's training. We shouldn't put too much expectation on it.",

My current assessment is that the training needs of any of us non-elite athlete are obvious enough without VO2max/CR information that testing for these is a waste of time, energy, and money. A key theme of this tread is minimizing the waste of our limited resources on less helpful aspects of training so that we can make the most of what we can give to training.

Initially I was disappointed but i’ve gotten more positive. Thinking this may be worth an 18:10 in the same conditions as last time and I have gotten quicker. Still seems like a good response to 5 weeks of training but interested to hear other opinions? I’m now going to step up to 5 days a week, then 6, and start building that 3rd SubT session very slowly and carefully. Very interested to see the response I get.",

    "message": "Two sessions is not really this method, in my opinion. I've learned that the hard way myself, take this from a point of trying to be helpful. The third session is absolutely key, I made this mistake myself. This is the x factor without it seemingly looking like the traditional x factor. We've seen many people try short cuts or very low mileage/ time per week. Ultimately, the best method is 4x easy and 3x sub threshold. The ones it's really, really and I mean really working for, are these people. I've seen guys in the Strava group make it work with 6. Or 5-6 days + 1-2 days cross training. Having said that, what you are doing is not likely bad, for really low mileage and that's a very impressive time on not a lot. Especially if you consider sirpoc , who is the absolute gold standard for this, even more than KI at this point, was running 6-7 days and 5-6 hours a week at one point and was pretty slow at around 19 flat. But this didn't happen overnight, he even said himself, it's a long slow road and not a lot happened to his own times for maybe the first 6-8 weeks. A grind almost. Look at his runs over the past 18months Hardly missed a single day. Does the same thing absolutely. I guarantee you today we see 10*1k on his feed. That's how predictable and repeatable his training is. But also how much consistency and dedication you need to put in if you want this. The times are impressive but in my opinion the level of dedication and training focus is absolutely remarkable and is often overlooked here. Now he is probably in the top road runners in his country in the 40+ category. It's entirely possible he could become a national champion in 5k road this year if he enters, I hope he does. But it's not just sirpoc, you look at the Strava group, the ones who have made very impressive jumps at all levels are the ones who have really not tweaked much from the original post he made a year ago now.",

This is 100% true and confirmed by one my best friends here mr Ghost 1 who has seen the coaching threads I still have left as a proof of what I have told here is 100% the truth. A few runners among the several hundreds of runners all over the world I have coached during now 10 years successful coaching lied to me about their traning results and race results . I still today really don't know why they did because they never asked me for money etc. Now to more spot on what this thread is about. There is absolutelly no need to buy equipment as lactate meters and so on to get the guaranteed improvement of individual running results . It's wasted money if you by experience know how to find out your most effective paces without measuring lactate. And what the thread's hero Sirpoc is doing in his lactate threshold training according to race results and training paces it's simply old fashioned Daniels VDOT paces at closer to LT2 than LT1 . Nothing new revolutionary to be seen here as the vast majority of people here seem to believe. And now finally in this long comment; You proposed I should start a new thread about my effective the Dancan system and my succesful coaching cases overvthe years.

There's a whole discussion of what sub-threshold pace is, and how it corresponds to other things. For me, I'm starting on the slow side, 5-15 seconds/mile slower than my theoretical 1-hour pace. Emphasize the \"sub\" in sub-threshold. 30 minutes is what some people do. Can you? I can't now, but I hope to get there. Other people can do more. Start with less and build up as you can.

To produce the desired lactate over half an hour's worth of work, for example, you will be running a lot faster in 10*3 min blocks and slower in 3*10 min blocks. But as has been talked about, in general if you dial it in right, you will be generating the same amount of lactate. 3 times a week, rest of the running easy. 25% of time on feet max for workouts. Follow that as a general guide, you will almost certainly get better. Others have dialled in the final bits, to really take them to the next level. But even on basics, the vast majority of people have improved and probably you only need to worry about the absolute basics for the first half a year. Yes, half a year. This is a long term commitment. But the rewards are there. The paces provided early on stand the test of time for a good percentage of people. Obviously, not for all. It's a guide. Tweaking here and there. But there's plenty of people where those paces have worked quite early, giving yourself a buffer either side a few seconds.

What I mean with this I tell then? Well, the sub threshold low mileage method works very good up to a given level when a plateau most truly will come and impossible to reach the individual optimal performance without implementing maxVO2 workouts that will complement the sub thresholds to be faster at same former effort. To sum up what I told in this comment I'm glad to see many runners improve with this method 😀, but I'm convinced out from my long experience they really need to implement maxVO2 and ' traditional LT work( around 4.0 mmol) to improve further and reach their highest possible results. 🇸🇪🧙🏼‍♂️🇸🇪",

With a week between workouts, you get lots of rest and it's easier to push yourself beyond what your body is ready for.

    "message": "I think of the hills or short track intervals, also referred to as the X-factor workout, as the workout that provides whatever needed stimuli isn't accomplished by all the easy volume and threshold work. What exactly that needed stimuli is here is specific to the development level and goals of the athlete. Part of it is target event -safe to say X-factor work is less relevant if you're priority races are 10km+, more important races 5km-. That being said, I'd say a larger part is the athletes development -what are someone's current performance limitations and what's the most effective way to address those. Threshold and easy volume are the meat and potatoes, X-factor is the sauce and seasoning. What a lot of people in this thread seem to be experiencing is that they don't have much need for anything beyond volume, threshold, and maybe some strides, or at least that they can still make good progress without much of anything resembling X-factor work. Most of us are running up against predominantly aerobic limitations so it makes sense to throw most/all of our workload towards addressing that limitation. Myself I don't really follow the \"method\" of this thread or the Bakken training exactly, but I do use a lot of the same guiding principles and my weekly structure looks somewhat \"Norwegian\". For background: formerly ran a lot and ran pretty fast in college several years, got really out of shape since then and now am a little over a year back into serious training again. Typical week I've done recently is ~130km, running twice/day 5x/week. All this is context to set up how I approach the X-factor day. Thanks to my talent and running history my innate speed/speed-endurance is pretty good, or at least relatively way better than my current aerobic fitness, but there are still some specific non-aerobic weaknesses I've noticed that I try to address. Among these are the skill of maintaining relaxed biomechanics while running 5k pace or faster, central max VO2/max HR ability, and just the mental toughness of being able to hurt. I've come up with two general workouts to address these aspects for myself. You'll notice these are not as hard/long as the X-factor sessions in the Bakken/Ingebrigtsen -given that I'm not a world-class 1500m/5000m runner and not training at their workload I don't need as big of a stimulus as those guys do. I do feel like this stuff has complemented the threshold running nicely and helps add some more fun to training. Funny enough though I'm now being forced into an all-sub-threshold scheme for a little while -I somehow got myself an intercostal muscle strain during some beer-fueled 4th-of-July swimming and currently can't breathe deep enough to run faster than MP without my chest feeling like it's going to explode. It will be an experiment to see how much X-factor work really matters.",

Some people ran short track races without the hills and seemed fine. I wonder if adding in hard hill/flat strides on the easy days would be enough? Something like 6-8 x 15-20s fast with walk/jog back recovery. You may struggle in an 800 off that training but a mile could still go pretty well. Another alternative would be to race into it. The first few short races might be tough, but if you can plan to do several of them, hobby joggers will probably be fine. If you’re trying to run 1:45 for 800, maybe not.",

Similarly at the highest workload blood lactate level was 30% higher during HEAT than in the NEUTRAL environment (4.6 ± 1.0 vs 3.5 ± 0.6 mmol/ L; respectively, p<0.05). In the HEAT the rate of blood lactate accumulation increased and lactate threshold took place at 175 watts while it took place at 200 watt in the NEUTRAL trial. Due to the increase in heart rate in the HEAT, heart rate at lactate threshold was similar in the HEAT and NEUTRAL environments (150 ± 1 beats/min).” Unrelated to the above study, I’ve heard Dr Geoff Burns say that heat is the largest waste product in exercise, which from a physics standpoint makes a lot of sense and is an interesting way to think about it.",

If you follow Gabriela DeBues-Stafford on Strava, she talks about this in her most recent workout. She plans on keeping track work (sounds like 200s or short reps at mile pace) in her rotation. I’m wondering if frequent strides and frequent races will fix this “stuck in threshold” issue? Or it could be something different that is contributing to the struggle with racing faster. Maybe these athletes feel flat from doing their threshold too fast. Gabriela DeBues-Stanford did a double threshold on a Tuesday, felt like trash on Wednesday and Thursday but still did another double threshold on Thursday, which she had to cut short because her lactate was too high. Obviously this thread is not about double thresholds but I think a lot of people are a bit nervous about neglecting fast work in this program.",

    "message": "I'll weigh in on my experience. 41M (5'11\", 150 lbs), ran in XC way back in high school (slow for the team, ~18:50 5k), decided to start running again 2 winters ago, don't really race, did a 10k in 44:00 last fall. Was running 30-40 MPW with 1 Daniels Style hard session, a long run, and a bunch of random Z2-3 miles. Was making some progress (trying to build to 40-50 MPW) but was feeling sore quiet often after the hard stuff. Got sick in February and tried to run through it, burnt myself out and took a few weeks off. After building back up in March/April to 40-50 MPW doing Z1-Z2 stuff, I stumbled on this thread and the idea of less hard stuff and more sub-T to stay on my feet seemed appealing so I decided to give it a go and stick to the plan for 10-12 weeks and see what happens. Weeks have all been the same. Last LTHR test was about 173, kept Max HR at the end of the subT workouts closer to 168-170. M - Easy 6 Miles Tu - 3x2k (~7:15/mile) w/ 1 minute recovery + WU/CU W - Easy 6 Miles Th - 7x1k (~7:00/mile) w/ 1 minute recovery + WU/CU F - Easy 6 Miles S - Easy 6 Miles Sun - Long 10 Miles(3 Easy, 4 @ 7:30 pace, 3 Easy) Basically, 50 Miles a week, 12 miles at sub-T (20%), All the rest done in upper Z1/lower Z2 (9-10 minute pace), repeated since May 1. Did a 5k TT on February 15 just before getting sick: Finally ran another one yesterday: Needless to say, I'm pretty bummed. I was hoping for a strong signal that the work had some effect. Thoughts: - I feel like I'm generally fitter, I've jumped up and additional 15-20 MPW and I feel much stronger on the larger workload. Very rarely sore, fine to repeat sub-T workouts 3x a week. Way different experience than Jan/February. - I feel like I'm really comfortable running in the 7-7:30/mile pace now. - That 5k felt way different than the hard running from over the winter. Almost Like my body doesn't remember how pull hard and maintain it, I ended up falling back to my workout pace by the end of it. - If I squint real hard I could say it was 40F hotter and way more humid out and I ran the same time (same course) at 4 BPM lower HR (even though I faded). I don't know if it's just the heat or that I haven't really pressed myself in almost 3 months and I forgot what time trial/race pace effort feels like or if this type of work is just not the stimulus I respond to. Was there any progress here? I don't know. I'm tempted to stick it out another few weeks and maybe run another 5k or two to see if it's just a matter of knocking the cobwebs out of my legs.",

Felt like I was stuck at threshold and just had absolutely nothing above that, given the volume of training and subT work I was so confident it'd go well, I was gutted. The good news: I then did a month of conventional training and speed work and took 15s off my 5k PB. Whilst I performed embarrassingly badly off the subT work, I think it gave me the aerobic base to build on when I piled on some intensity. In future I plan to cycle between base phase (easy+speed), SubT, and then a conventional block. I think if you race every 3 weeks like SP and have a similar morphology to him you can get away with it. This however isn't possible for me and I tend to have a few target races across a year.",

If you are looking to race mostly 5ks I think it would benefit to have some shorter distance repeats at faster distances. You are getting enough mileage but your fastest workout (7x1k) is at 7 minute pace. That's still slower than your current 5k pace that you aren't happy with. So it doesn't seem like that much of a surprise that you have trouble maintaining a faster pace when you never train at that faster pace for any distance. If you want to keep 2 repeats a week, then I would remove the 3x2k and replace it with 20x400m or 12x600m workout with 30 sec rest at your perceived 5k pace. Or a workout similar. Or just add that workout to your existing for 3 total and alternate days from easy 6 and your repeats/long run. I know it shifts all your workouts every week to a different day but that's what I do as it allows me to get 3 repeat workouts in and a long run in an 8 day timeframe without any of them ever being back to back. What pace is your 6 miles at? According to this training plan they should be slow, probably around 9min pace for your current 5k time. Same with your 10 miler.",

For me, and most runners, 35-45 degrees for a TT or race is when the body is at its absolute optimal. Anything over 65 F and the effects start to become It is to the point where, as I do this mainly for times and PRs, I don’t even bother racing if it is over 70. As many have pointed out, a lot of runners will perform poorly after just Sub T or even LT work.

If you do 2 more of these sessions this week while at 50K/31 miles per week, you'll do around 11% of your weekly distance at subthreshold pace. And that's a perfectly fine place to start. You have lots of time to increase volume and pace. I'd even say that you shouldn't increase either one for now. Something that takes some getting used to is the daily grind and figuring out what pace you can hold, in workouts and on easy runs, day after day. Take a few weeks to see how it goes.

Similar to a few others in this thread, I have a pretty solid background from running in the NCAA but now, having graduated a few years ago, don’t have the time and flexibility to train. I have a meter and have been measuring lactate. I can do 4 x mile at 5:30 off 90s and stay below threshold. I can do 6 x mile off 90s a bit slower and achieve a similar lactate. A big part of the discrepancy at the moment is that I’m not very fit yet due to the time off. That 5th mile at 5:30 spikes me too high. But doing 6 x mile a bit slower, I typically test pretty low until the last rep, where I see a bit of a spike. Eventually, as my ability to clear lactate improves, I expect to see smaller spikes in lactate with the increases in volume. Would it be better to stay at that 4 miles worth of work range at a faster pace or keep it at 6 miles and work the pace down gradually over time?",

    "message": "This question's been asked quite a bit in this long thread. I think the general advice has been that the volume of your sessions should be dictated by your overall training volume. In this system, your time at sub-threshold should be between 20% and 25% of your weekly mileage. If you're running ~7 hours a week that's around 90 minutes of sub-threshold. Three sessions each with ~6 miles of volume would achieve this. If you're running less then shortening the sessions to fewer reps would be appropriate. Your pace during these sessions should be dictated by whatever keeps you in the right lactate zone. This can be achieved by looking at any of a number of metrics (HR, pace and lactate testing are the popular ones). So if you're choosing lactate as your metric then yes you'll have to run a little faster to get the same lactate reading as your threshold increases, but your goal would be to hit the lactate measurement rather than to increase your pace.",

    "message": "You can manipulate the pace by extending the recovery in between reps as well. For example, in the Bakken paper, he demonstrates one athlete's training (almost certainly Jakob), who could run 20-25 x 400m @ 64 seconds, with a recovery of 30 seconds. When the recovery was extended to 60 seconds, the athlete could average 62s. Both produced the same lactate levels at the end (just slightly below LT2). Therefore, you could keep the same volume in your workouts, but extend the recoveries to keep the intensity in the threshold range. Personally, I'd drop the volume just slightly at first (maybe down to 5 miles), and then gradually lift - just to be on the conservative side.",

So I'll switch to that. I've just bought Daniel's 73rd edition and will start pounding out threshold runs and hill sprints over the next 12 weeks. I'll be taking inspiration from the college system of course as well. To get into the spirit Hard2find has kindly sent me one of his spare red M.A.G.A hats to keep the sun out of my eyes on my runs and Shirtboy is going to provide me with my own personal handgun for protection whilst out running. If you are going to do the American Method, you must cover all bases and become American. Of course, when the next Incredible international performance comes, I'll jump on that bandwagon. As we all expect the Great swede to probably break the 20 mins barrier in the over 65 world masters next year, I expect I'll just jump onto the magic DANCAN system.

Avg Temperature = 79.3 F / 26.3 C Avg Humidity = 96% Avg Weight Loss = 5.1 lbs / 2.3 kg Every data point in the sample is from a 6 x 1600m session, performed outdoors, at the same location and same morning start time. I started the block with a 6 x1600m lactate test. From that data, I defined my speed at LT (vLT) and my heart rate at LT (LTHR). In my specific case, I could be as high as 110% of LTHR while running at a speed less than vLT and reading lactate around 1.5-2.5 mmol/l. Where as, if I was in that same heart rate range as a result of running faster than vLT, my lactate varied from about 2.0 to 5.0 mmol/l. The takeaway, using heart rate as a proxy for lactate would be very inconsistent in the heat and humidity, in my situation. Hopefully the document provides some interesting data for those curious about this.",

    "message": "Here we go again indeed… To your first point, I think that is nuanced. There is a correlation, it just varies in strength and is subject to circumstance. For instance, on a treadmill, indoors, in an optimal temperature and humidity, there will be less variability than in a hot and humid environment where even running at an easy pace for long enough can drive your heart rate to LTHR (depending on your definition). So, in my experience, context matters. In fact, I’m planning to repeat this experiment on a treadmill indoors and again outdoors when the weather improves. If I am wrong (meaning if the variance is not reduced), I will personally buy you a pair of super shoes for your sub 20 minute 5k attempt! You’ll need them : ) Furthermore, to address controlling for one of your nutritional concerns (hydration), I’ve invented a portable, though not potable, device called The Six Shooter. It’s a digital hydration analysis station you can take to the track and set on the infield at the finish line for a 6 x 1600m session. At the end of each repeat, just center yourself over it and urinate into one of the six 8 oz cylinders. Voila, now hydration status can be accurately accounted for! Disclaimer, company will not be held liable for indecent public exposure. As for defining LT. I’ll just reiterate that I chose to use Dmax, which is not LT1, nor LT2. It’s just a method that results in a point on the lactate curve, approximating LT, as the result of a mathematically defined method. You literally made the point, but then somehow missed the point, that there is not a well defined nor agreed upon “threshold” value to use. So, I was simply using the Dmax value to define a basis for vLT and LTHR. I could have chosen modified Dmax, LT1, LT2, 2.0 mmol/l, 4.0 mmol/l, OBLA 1 to infinity... With in reason, it’s all arbitrary. Lastly, yes, I am very much a “slow twitch dominant” runner. Which probably explains why it's so easy for me to shuttle your waste when you exceed your threshold.",

Sure. Does it matter, given that I took the time to say what I was doing and explain how I was using the term LT, vLT, and LTHR? To me, no, researchers do it all the time. I really don’t know what your problem is? Whatever basis I chose, the data is still the same with the same structure to it. It’ll just be on a different scale. I could have stuck with using the raw speed and heart rate as well, but thought it would be more relatable in percentage terms. And again, you keep using LT2 when I never mentioned that. I chose to use LT generically, similar to how the researchers in the universal running equation paper you linked chose to define LT as the baseline lactate value plus a constant term (I believe 1.5 mmol/l). Some researchers even use the term LT to represent LT1 and LTP to represent LT2. Maybe you can bother them instead.

In the \"Predicting Lactate Based on Heartrate\" and \" Predicting Lactate Based on Speed\" Graphs it looks like staying below LTHR kept you in a good range for lactate whereas staying below vLT you had a bigger lactate range. So the way I read this, if I don't want to overdo my workout I'm better off focusing on LTHR as opposed to vLT. Maybe heart rate is not a good predictor of lactate but keeping your heart rate below LTHR is a reliable way to make sure you're not pushing your lactate to high.",

    "message": "The take-home is that the relationship between HR and metabolism in tough environmental conditions becomes decoupled, and what you do with that information depends on what kind of runner you are. For repeated sub-threshold training, it all comes down to which factors influence recovery the most. The heat stress is showing up in elevated heart rate, but since lactate is not rising, work at the higher heart rate is still sub-threshold. The concern would be whether doing all that work in the heat causes a greater load that is not captured by lactate measurements and you're just going to cook yourself despite hitting lactate targets -- but broadly speaking, the reason lactate measurements are popular is because they're a better proxy for work than HR, and your recovery depends way more on that than your core temperature, hydration status, elevation, etc. If you feel the same as always during a sub-threshold workout in the heat, then look down and see your HR is 5 bpm higher, you probably should not be concerned.",

And you suggesting using Mod Dmax instead of Dmax doesn’t change my lactate curve, so choosing that point is as arbitrary a basis as Dmax or LT2. I genuinely don’t understand how this is such an issue for you. I’ve always been a low producer of lactate, that just appears to be my physiology. An example of a more prominent athlete, is Reed Fischer. He recorded a video of his LT and VO2max test. His lab tested LT2 was 1.3 mmol/l. Alberto Salazar is another example, per Jack Daniels own data. Also, take a look at some of the curves Andy Jones published based on his testing of all the athletes involved in the Breaking 2 project. There’s a lot of variation there. Also, Jones uses LT and LTP to describe LT1 and LT2, so please make sure to email him and tell him he is doing it wrong. Yes, there’s always the possibility of hydration, glycogen levels, and time of day playing a role. I did my best to control for this by eating and hydrating well (pretty standard for me anyway) and starting at the same time each morning. The whole point of this was to present some ”real-world” data in a hot and humid environment as opposed to on a treadmill, in a lab. For most of us, training doesn’t take place there.",

However (and if I’ve misunderstood your suggestion, do correct me), in the case of predicting lactate based on LTHR if you look up the vertical axis, based on observed lactate values less than or equal to 2.0, you’ll see a lot of points where I am above LTHR yet my observed lactate is of course below 2.0. So, trying to keep the whole session below LTHR would result in running a pace much slower than I could actually run and still stay at a lactate below 2.0. Does that make sense? I probably could have written more of a detailed analysis/interpretation to address some of those observations, but left it pretty minimal. I’ll try and improve that with future experiments.",

These guys are both ~15 min 5k runners. Some people just run like that. It's not rare. As for whether strides are useful: my theory which has absolutely no hard evidence is that while many can get away with skipping strides or other short reps, some people (like me) find that they're absolutely critical to running well. Sirpoc can lock in to sub 3:10 pace over a 5k even though the fastest (that I could see) he's gone in training is somewhere in the mid 3:10s. Even at my fittest aerobically, I feel like I'm sprinting at my 5k pace if I've been skipping strides. I used to think that the solution to this would be hard Vo2 reps on the track, or 1km reps at goal 5k pace to 'get used to' running faster over an extended period. I'm now trying the system described in this thread so I'm not ever going quicker than 10k pace during a session but I'm doing a set of strides at the end of each warmup so my body doesn't 'forget' how to move at 1500m-3k pace. These strides feel incredibly low risk and since they're only about 80m or so they barely spike my HR.",

Haven't run another time trial but based on the comments here I decided to stick with the plan until the fall to see the experiment through. Haven't changed anything except. Just tried to pay more attention and make sure the easy days are as easy as they can be in the heat. Honestly, it was pretty much just more of the same slog. This week we finally got a cool front. For context, the last three months running conditions most mornings have been around 75-85F and dewpoints 65-75F. This week a cold front came through (isn't sticking around unfortunately) and I've been running around 65-70F with dewpoints in the 55-60F. The week after the 5k TT I was disappointed in (same ~20:55 result as one I ran in February) I ran my normal Thursday 7x1k w/ 1 minute rest: Last rep 5 seconds slow than first, generally disappointing, and felt pretty consistent compared to recent efforts. Same workout today: I finished this morning's session out like a hummingbird. Felt like I could've run another 4 or 5 reps at the pace I finished interval 7 at (6:24/mile) or quicker. Breaths were easy and long, legs were light and quick, effort felt very moderate. Last rep 20 seconds faster than first and wasn't trying to press it at all, each one just kind ended up feeling looser than the last. My 3x2k on Tuesday was similarly strong. It felt/feels like I'm inhabiting a completely different body. I've looked at a few workouts from before I started on subT workout but it's hard to compare since I didn't really run anything at this effort, either above or below. At any rate, I don't think there's anyway I could've hacked todays paces on 1 minute rest at all, and certainly wouldn't have finished my cool down feeling like I could do it all over again. Thanks to everyone who responded that my TT actually indicated improvement compared to when I started this all several month ago. I was quite concerned about the only goal I had set for the year (which was to improve at least somewhat on my 10k from last fall where I ran a 7:10/mile pace when I run it again in a couple month). After this week I'm not super worried anymore even with more heat coming back into the forecast for a bit. I'm actually looking forward to tuning up in the cooler weather next month and running some race efforts to see where I'm at.",

What got me here? -Masters athlete -Stagnating last years -Reflections on my training from last years My are PBs all from 2019/20/21 with one expection. Last year when I accepted for myself the PBs might be over for this life I ran a half marathon PB in October. Sadly I got injured right after that and took my 6 months with running very little till was able again to run 4-5 times a week. I did cross train though a lot during fall and winter. And I spent quite some time looking for reasons how I got this unexpected PB on the half. The explanation and think to have found in my training logs. I always was on very good shape when training specifically for a half. After that often I also did run good 10km and 5km. But the more I then focussed on shorten distances (also tried two track season) did help me lowering my times significantly. Als I recognized that continuous tempo/threshold runs were often the hardest for me. In training plans often I need manage to achieve as they were intended whereas I had no issues for the shorter intervals up to 1000m. So last year I decided that I would try work on this weakness and incorporated one longer threshold (half marathon pace) run per week. That was probably one important element for the HM other than that I did not trained even too hard last summer. During current season I decided to look out more specificly for ideas around threshold based training or training which would help me work on my \"tempo endurance\" deficit. I am closed to 50 and definetely on the slower side in this thread. Ran a 20:59 on 5000 track and my best parkrun this year only 21:45 or so on a very good course. Stumbling on this thread 2-3 months ago and worked completely through it I started transitioning on the Sub-T concept mit July. In average I have done 2 Sub-T sessions a week. Had two races which has cost me 2 of those sessions each with taper and recovery after. Will report on my progess here and on Strava. Next two weeks will be hard to follow exact structure as I have some races and will just easy runs in-between (or use races to go on Sub-T pace). So more datapoints on my current fitness to come. and from 2nd September week will to very consitent Sub-T block of 6-8 weeks and see how I respond to this.",

Things today just felt good and moderate so I just kept going after 4 and finished a 10k at subT effort (did not press it) since this is the last cooler day for a while. Probably overly optimistic but when I finished the subT portion I remember feeling like I could've kept that pace for another 4-5 miles if I wanted. 15 degrees warmer, 20 seconds faster pace, and just a way easier effort than my previous PR 10k.

    "message": "Just a quick update from the beginning of this experiment. I have two more race times, an identical-to-the-second 5K (18:21) and a slightly disappointing 10K (call it 38 mid, adjusted for a long course). So that's where my fitness is for comparison's sake. I probably won't have another chance to race until spring at least, but I'm hoping to do 5K-HM next summer on similar or the same courses as recent races, which should give me a good sense of what this training can do. A few more notes: - I'm using a SubT-Easy-SubT-Easy-SubT-Long-Off schedule. - Hitting 3 workouts a week seems like a key ingredient. Even at just 3-4 miles of volume at pace, the frequent stimulus hits different. - I notice some cumulative fatigue with each workout, which may not be the goal. Or maybe stressing recoverability is the point? I'm still adjusting workouts and paces. - Getting up to 4 miles of workout volume is useful, as it opens up the longer intervals (2K/3K). 3 x 2K has actually been one of the more difficult workouts, while 2 x 2mi has been fine. Go figure. - At 12 miles of workout volume per week, I'm putting in more work at pace than in any of my previous race buildups and doing a higher percentage of up-tempo running. - I wonder how much of the improvement is mechanical. According to Garmin, my weekly average steps per minute and stride length are noticeably higher. That's got to have some kind of effect. - Without any races, I might try a steady-10K alternation workout once a month or so as a loose fitness check. - I'm currently experimenting with 6 miles of total workout volume just to see what it's like. 3 x 2mi wasn't too bad. We'll see if it's sustainable.",

The workouts themselves (4 x 1.5 miles, 6 x 1 mile, 12 x 800) went fine, but it took longer to recover from the second session and I needed a second easy day before the third workout. The problem wasn't fatigue, but persistent soreness in my hamstrings/glutes and I didn't want to push too close to the edge. So I think I can build up to it, but I'm not there yet. \"High volume, not high mileage\" is an accurate description. It's really nice to be able to fit a workout into little more than an hour. It's a lot easier on family life than telling my wife that I'm heading out for a 20 miler that will take 3 hours or so. And I actually feel pretty good physically the rest of the day, instead of feeling wiped out afterwards. One thing that will be an issue is trying to keep the sub-threshold volume to 25% of weekly volume. On six days, I was somewhere over 33% last week (18 miles sub-T and just over 50 total). So I also need to build up overall mileage, which honestly seems slightly more challenging than hitting the three sub-T workouts. Since the challenge for me is recovering, I've had to cut back on lifting a lot. I'll try adding it back in once I reach a stable plateau in workout volume and weekly mileage.",

He did mile reps last week with a few under 5:10. That’s right around 10k pace and incredibly close to 5k pace. He’s either due for some massive PBs or is just so strong from all the threshold work that his paces are really close together. Even his easy runs are sub-7 minute mile pace now. It’s been pretty cool to see. But again, I think most people who are in 15:45/32 flat shape would struggle to hit the paces that he does week in and week out for both easy and sub-T days.",

I assume the race he did yesterday was a course record, I've looked it up on Strava going back to 2016 and 1:12 flat is by far the fastest on that course. To qualify for Championship entry for London on a hilly course like that is pretty damn impressive. I enjoy seeing the progress he makes still. Whilst I love watching elite athletics; seeing someone with a family, job, life outside of running, not taking it super seriously and past their prime (like most of us!) but still run to a sub elite level, makes me think I can do it!",

My only change to the plan is that I replace Mondays easy run with a rest day. For background I've been running on and off for 16 years (I'm 38 now). I've run low 17s in the past last when I've been fitter. From experience if I'd trained the way I used to for the last 16 weeks I would have expected to have improved by probably 10-15 seconds. So it's a bit disappointing to be treading water with this method so far. Anyone have any tips? Is it likely that this method just isn't for me? Or if I stick with it for another month or two might I still get a breakthrough?",

There's maths somewhere in the thread sirpoc posted of WHY he believes it works and the more I have done it myself and looked into the others who have succeeded, I'm almost certain this is correct. I have shamelessly copied sirpoc for 20 weeks now and had big success, the first 10-15 I tried to be clever for my HM and incorporate stuff into the long run etc. it just complicates it and created an imbalance in how I felt versus copying by the book. I wouldn't change, what isn't broken. Right up to HM I would not change anything that's been suggested. Virtually every success of the huge amount I've seen, it's sticking to the format. Too many people are making the big mistake I think of HM changing way too much. Look at KI and sirpoc, neither has a much better distance right up to HM and we are only talking 30-35 mins work per session. Sirpoc just ran 1:12 flat on a course that I would say looks one of the most challenging I've seen on paper, for a road course. It seems a pretty narrow window we are targeting and the 7 runs in the 3+4 format over time seem to be what does the trick.",

Sorry for the wall of text here… I found this thread in june and converted from a more polarized training regime to this sub threshold. Thanks a lot. Feeling stronger, healthier and have no injuries/niggles. I now run a three double sub- threshold a week. The rest is easy. Even though it sound much I have not found it taxing at all. I control and reduce impact by running some uphill on a ski slope, use treadmill inclination and run off trail on soft surface in the Forrest. I run approximately 9,5 hours a week. The easy runs and long run are at 60% off my Max HR. The morning LT1 sessions is very controlled. I sit around 153-155 in HR and my LT1 maxHR is 158 max. My max HR is 198. All from a lab test one year ago. My LT2 from the lab sits at 184 HR And stay with me soon comes my question…. When I do my LT2 sessions. I can do 6x5’ and progress it to 165 HR. I can also do 10x3’ and progress it to 170. I know this is quite a gap from 184 which is my max LT2HR but I’m doing three doubles a week. Sometimes I think I’m to conservative and sometimes I’m afraid I will overdo it if I speed up. So my question to you insightful people here if you think I’m spot on here or should go a bit higher on the HR in the LT2 sessions? And the easier LT2 sessions where I sit at 165 HR are they giving me anything? I mean that they are close to LT1 but also a bit far from LT2… At the moment I train for 10k but I will do the half marathon i the future… And yes I will probably get a lactate meter but in the meantime I need to controll it with HR.

Ran 20:57 (mile splits - 6:35,6:51,6:48, and + 0:42), was 35F out and I was in Z5 pretty much from end of mile 1, Avg HR last mile+ was 178 (Max is a few BPM above 180 these days). Was completely gassed. Ran the same route this weekend in 65F and ran 20:11 (k splits - 4:02, 4:05, 4:04, 4:05, 3:54). Avg HR last 2k was 168. I hardly reached Z5 during the effort. Felt pretty normal within a minute of finishing. I think it's pretty clear that I've made some decent aerobic progress using this method. Moving from a 5k at 6:45 pace to 6:30 while dropping my avg HR 10 BPM, even on the last mile+. But comparing the 2 TT's I'm seeing that I was clearly capable of holding my HR up much higher earlier in the year (and I doubt that I've aged out of that capability since February), so it was a bit disappointing in that regard. I don't feel like I pushed myself into what I used to consider race effort. I suspect there's a bunch of extra headroom available to me during races if I can get used to pushing into that final gear this fall. It's been talked about here that racing often may be an important part of the plan. I can now see the progress from the hot and humid summer months, but I definitely felt rusty. I've got a 10k race coming up in a couple of weeks and now that the weather's cooler I'd like to swap in that race effort periodically to get that VO2 max stimulus and get back into the mindset of \"this is a race, it's supposed to hurt, just push it.\" What's the thought on how often to race and what to do in the days leading up to it? I was thinking a 5k or 10k ever 2 or 3 weeks? What's does the week leading up to the race look like? Cut the 2 preceding subTs to 2/3 and 1/2 volume? Keep the volume and reduce the pace of the workout? I imagine it'll take a month or two to figure out how my body responds to a new change in effort but I'm curious what others are doing/have tried.",

One thing I've found is without racing or simulating (VO2 work?) it's really hard if not impossible to find that extra gear.

I notice a lot of pushback from the group when someone floats the idea of doing the hills as a third workout instead of 3 sub t method sirpoc made popular. I for one am doing the X factor hills session rather than an additional sub t. I’ve experimented with both, and my results have been greater with the hills. Long runs are generally frowned upon (at least in the traditional sense) but I think there is still a huge benefit for those racing longer distances to go more than 75-90 minutes. I think using the long run with sub-t mixed in as the third session has benefits too. im not trying to derail the thread and I guess my point is we can still experiment with this method rather than follow the letter of the law that was unofficially established somewhere down the line.

It's at the point where let's be honest he would be about a KM ahead at least of KI on the same course. So a huge margin. That's not to knock KI, but I think people totally underestimate how impressive and good sirpoc has got. Just because he is new to the sport he's not new to understanding training and what works. He probably has put a basic program together that would get most people closer to their potential than 90% of coaches who you have to pay for.

When I say exactly, massive blocks of absolutely identical to this with 3x easy, 3x sub threshold / sweetspot @ 2*15 or 3*20 and 1 really long ride. The only diffence being the extra volume on the bike. He just fell into the Daniel's marketing trap like we all have when you Google running programs and then quickly realised time to revert back to old methods. Maybe the Kristoffer was a fan of the British time trial scene. Of course I jest, if you speak to sirpoc he lifted the methods he told me from fellow cyclists, who lifted it from a swim coach, who lifted it from speed skaters, who likely lifted it from Norwegian cross coutnry skiers.

If you see and read into the posts on Strava, he clearly has talent but I doubt there is any hobby joggers out there who has got as near to the maximum ability you can, on hours available as he has, when you consider the god given talent. Also the mental will power to just continue to slowly chip away by doing the same thing over and over. I don't think he posts here anymore but the indication is he will run the London marathon next year from Strava. Then it will be really interesting to have followed this method through from what started out as a park run hobby jogger level through to championship London race entry. As others have said above.

    "message": "The \"bang for buck TSS\" idea I think is secondary to the fact that Sirpoc had massive success cycling with 3 sub T. As others have said, this is actually fairly common training in cycling, so he had that as further validation to stick to it. Then, within that framework, he uses TSS along with how his workouts are going, to triangulate the shape he's in. Pretty smart. The TSS comparison of this vs Daniels was trying to objectively say that 3 sub T generates more load than than Daniels. I think you can also get a subjective feeling for this, that Vo2 workouts ask a lot of you and then you just can do as much during the rest of the week-- TSS is just a formal way to compare it. Hard2Find had a great post earlier in the thread about the drawbacks of TSS. It is heavily biases volume over intensity. For example, 25 min at Interval, 32 min at Threshold and 53 min at Easy (all JD paces) generate 60 TSS according to Hard2Find's TSS calculator spreadsheet. The recovery needed for those workouts are ridiculously different. The take away is that TSS isn't everything, but it's a helpful metric to track consistency/ progress if you're already working within a logical training framework. I suspect that what is optimal is highly individual, and that in the vast majority of cases good training that you do consistently will always beat spotty training that may be \"ideal.\" To the posters above who say that those with success stick closely to Sirpoc's guidelines, my suspicion is that what's happening is that those people are more consistent than the people changing things up. If you create a plan that's similar but different from Sirpocs and you stick to it, you may get just as good of results. I think the reason is that the range of sub T paces/ durations is actually much broader than what Sirpoc does. But what Sirpoc works, so why change it? I think if you're following a hard/ easy approach, what Sirpoc does is probably very close to ideal. Maybe if you're weaker on the endurance side 40-45 min worth of intervals at M pace may be better than 36 min at Sub T. But now we're splitting hairs, and its probably best to just get out and run. If you're willing to break the hard/ easy approach, there are a lot of ways to generate more TSS in a week, like the 30 min at M a day that the poster above mentioned. I suspect that there will be greater variability with this kind of clustering, meaning some will do great and some will break, and the hard/ easy will probably be best for most people most of the time. But the ultimate question is, does this higher TSS convert to greater fitness and faster times? I've heard Sirpoc estimate that there may be about a 10-15% difference in performance based on how you generated your TSS. Say person A gets 60 CTL through lots of all easy running, person B through 3 sub T, and person C through a Daniels program. The variation in performance between those groups may be 10-15%, so TSS gets us in the right ballpark but isn't predictive. 3subT gets us the load with less time than plan A, and is more repeatable than plan C. I suspect the variation in performance is largely due to one's training history and general strengths/ weaknesses. For example, my 5k time is much better than my 10k time which is much better than my HM time. I suspect for me, that more volume at the lower end of the sub T range is more beneficial than the shorter reps (400s, 1000s). Below is the schedule I've experimented with for 4 weeks. I just had a break due to Covid, and am torn between picking it back up or going to the traditional 3 sub T. Monday- 1 hr with 8x 4 min LT2 Tuesday-1 hr with 45 min at LT1 (90% of M pace) 3x 15 min for example Wednesday- 90 min easy Thursday- 1 hr with 4 x 10 min at M pace and slightly quicker Friday- 1 hr with 45 min at LT1 (90% of M pace) Saturday- 1 hr easy Sunday- 1 hr with 45 min at LT1 (90% of M pace) My CTL shot up doing this vs 3 sub T. My experience is that the fatigue you get from LT1 work is completely different than the fatigue from LT2. One way to describe it is that running LT1 simulated high milage. It's still Z2 in 5 zone model work, but with 45 min at LT1 I felt like it was more like a 90 min easy run. Interestingly, this pace is about 88% of JD's T pace, which is at the low end of sweetspot for cycling. I like my easy days in the woods so I'm leaning towards going back to 3 sub T. Kinda funny, my garmin was going crazy during this period. My estimated VO2 max shot up and my estimated 5k time was in the 15s when my PR is high 17s lol. Clearly it's wrong, but maybe it's directionally correct? It's hard to tell knowing that TSS is biased towards volume/ distance. Am I just optimizing for something that isn't that important for a 5k? Maybe. Would this improve my HM? That seems likely, given how poor my HM is compared to 5k. Again, only did it for 4 weeks and then got Covid so not much of a sample size.",

    "message": "I actually do read here when I can. But haven't really felt like I've had much to add for a while. Firstly, great post - hope you are in the Strava group (although I feel with a post like that you probably already are!). Secondly, just to state for the wider audience; I don't think there is inherently anything special about sub threshold. At all. I just think it's probably the easiest range to control, as well as the easiest to access or qualify in some way , along with seemingly fitting the various \"load\" models the best. The key being you can easily build more in, you should know where your fitness is, which will also lead to better performance. I will however, probably die on the hill of saying until I've seen evidence otherwise, for the aerobically underdeveloped runner, this is probably as good as you are gonna get in terms of bang for your buck on 5+ hours a week (with the odd tweak here or there for individuality or how a good coach might adapt slightly). Once you get to maybe 8.5-9+, again there are better ways to train (doubted t at a lower intensity). Under 5 hours (apart from just starting out) I would probably just roll the dice and do something aggressive from a Daniel's book. So that already takes out a large percentage of the population who could be doing this. Inside of that though, I do think as a cut and paste regime off the shelf, it's as likely as anything if not more so to give you success. I think, as you mention poster above, consistency is as much the key to this as any other single factor. One other point of note, yes I did say there's probably a 10% swing or so in either direction. Guys much smarter than me when it came to looking at cycling data (and some swimming) for guys who had trained various ways over various seasons - found there was actually not a huge amount of difference between plan A versus plan B versus plan C. Say a 300w on a pretty standard cycling plan of 20 years ago might get you 300w. A totally unstructured plan might get you 270-280w and something that gave you best bang for your buck, over a potentially shorter but more condensed time period (sweetspot), might gain you 320-330w. Again though, this is for time limited guys - not elite level. FWIW my data was the most outlier, in that it was almost identical for me no matter what - and I did try a totally awful training plan of just riding 2.5-3 hours a day at zone 2 (but took way longer). Is this going to be the case for running? Who knows. Runners are bad record keepers in terms of accurate data. Myself and Hard2find also talk about this most days and know that the original model TSS was built on probably has some flaws , which come down to expected power duration curves. Hard2find, if anyone, might find an alternative. If anyone can, it would be him (and to make it running specific). The other thing I will mention is cross training. If you are going to cross train I would be pretty confident in doing this plan but across whatever method you are doing alongside running. What makeup that is in terms of balance, I don't know. But shirtboy has been doing something similar and he's basically not gotten worse at running - and he's barely a runner now (I don't think he will mind me saying that 😅). Following the same plan whilst injured, or something similar with lots of cycling sweetspot also probably is a smart thing to do. Jiggymeister came back quite quickly from injury and was pretty good quite quickly with a large TSS load from cycling. So I would say the next natural progression of the thread is other people sharing not just their running experiences but also how or why maybe they have cross trained using the same basic principles.",

To try and get you in to the sub threshold Look at sirpoc or KI runs. We have lots of clear data for them. Sirpoc might do 3:16 one week, other weeks we see 3:23 say the week before, all for the SAME DISTANCE. The conditions and a whole number of factors effect the running pace. But he or KI do not care about the pace in reality, just that they are probably reaching around or just below LTHR as a rough rule of thumb, by say the end of the last rep. If people don't understand this then firstly, don't come here and try and act clever when you aren't. Secondly, understanding this is absolutely fundamental to making 3x sub threshold sessions a week work. Where you are pushing the limits but never exceeding it. The \"paces\" are just a rough guide to get you started. That aren't set in stone as there is technically no actual definitive sub threshold pace itself.",

    "message": "My experience is very much this when it comes to paces. Eventually you just learn to accept you are going for effort (and using pace/HR/LT as a proxy) and the results is going to be highly dependent on the day and what else is going on. Mostly I try to just get going and settle into an effort level for the rep distance, then after about 5 to 7 minutes of subT work I'll note the pace and have a pretty good idea of how the rest of the workout is going to go that day. Some days I look at the pace after that first period and think, alright we're moving pretty good! Other days I look at it, shake my head, and think oh well, that's just the way it's gonna be today, let's do the work and move on. Took a couple of months to figure it out but realizing that the goal isn't to hit the same or better paces than the previous week, but to get the work in an make sure your good to go again in 2 days. If the end of my workouts has me at or preferably just below LTHR, I'm normally pretty happy, but that's normally just a consequence of getting the effort level right across the entirety of the workout. Pace could easily be 10-20 seconds slower than the previous week for any number of reasons but over time it'll all come out in the wash over time. It's always nice to have a quick day though.",

I think the biggest thing for me with this type of training is that it made MP feel easier throughout the actual race--I ran the last 10k in 46:55 for a 3:20:41 and was able to speed up at the end, and I have run the last 10k of a marathon around 48-51 in my prior four marathon attempts. Another takeaway is doing it by TIME and not being married to pace--there were/are days where I feel better than others and sub-threshold could be as slow as 8:10 (humid July days) and others as fast as 7:35-ish.",

    "message": "Hi guys! Good to see this thread still going. Just thought I would add my thoughts. Firstly, of course I agree you have to understand there is actually no pace in play here. If you look and follow sirpoc, often there's a few seconds swing either way on paces. It's not perfect! But what he does is the effort levels look very similar week to week, despite the pace. Obviously everything slowly increasing over time. It's very measured and very controlled. The original posts were a lovely guide for me to get started though. After maybe a month you start to understand and get a feeling for what the effort will be that than ends around or just below that LTHR line by that key last rep. As for myself, I am 38 year old and this year I have PR at every distance from the Mile up to marathon. My best PB was bringing my 5k down from 19:33 to 17:52 just yesterday at my local Park run. I have only been following this method, apart from 7 races over the year to date, since around Januar. The biggest breakthrough came after maybe 10 weeks and then another huge breakthrough in early September. There's no magic to this but the consistency is unreal! It's almost metronomic in that aspect. Previous 3 seasons I have struggled to get any kind of form and when I had it vanished quickly. With this I feel like I am just improving and improving, pretty much non tapering races and then still good to go and just carry on. My assumption from following sirpoc on Strava is this is how it's meant to all work and feel. Many thanks to everyone else who has contributed. There were a few other posters who also had tried it and gave me the confidence to push all the chips in on this. My running group said I was mad and would lack speed.......now they are all asking me where I found this information and who sirpoc is after me suddenly becoming the strongest runner rather than weakest in our XC relay squad. The irony. It's funny, they also claim I must be doing secret workouts as I see claims made to sirpoc himself! Anyway, I hope maybe this information might also resonate with one other person who is on the fence and to try this. I will say, have confidence in it and try and understand and follow it as close as you can. A bit of an oxymoron, but in my eyes it's as complicated and easy to get wrong as it is simple!",

    "message": "This is where I think sirpoc has had more success than KI, well in my opinion anyway. I would say sporadic racing with a tiny taper like sirpoc does is a safer dynamic than then switching to the more aggressive hill repeats or vo2 work on a weekly basis. Obviously we are only comparing two people , but these are two who have likely stuck to this the longest where we have literally all the sessions available. But I worried for KI as soon as he started the regular work above Threshold. They were both doing around the same for a while and were both on around the same level. The weird thing is they were both still improving, so I'm not convinced I know why KI started to mix things up. If your PBs stop, sure, take a chance on being more aggressive. But he was still going great. Whereas sirpoc has stuck it out totally like a machine and is now miles ahead of KI level who also seems to have started picking up injuries. For the record, I count 8 5ks or parkruns that sirpoc has done since November last year. So we are sort of around once every 6-7 weeks it would seem as a blanket average. But that also includes 3 10ks and a HM in that time. I personally consider that a hell of a lot of racing in a year but I do think that helps put sprinkles on the already great system. Unfortunately where I am in the world, there is no Parkrun local to me. I think this is a big factor, as I know I would be motivated perhaps to do and do this with other people. If you see in the Strava group, a huge chunk of the UK or Aussie guys are doing parkruns but also training like this.",

    "message": "So i started to train this way and i think it is a great method. I have a race in 2 months, so then I will see the first results. What I really like is the simplicity: 25% LT work = intervalls with short rest Pick: 20x400, 8xk ,3x2k ,2x3k 75% Daniel E pace running No peridisation, no drills, no complicated mixed workouts. For the guys complaining about lack of speed work, Nobody stops you from: A) Adding a day of strides/ hill sprints, if you do it the Norway singles is quiet similar to Hudson or Pfizinger type of training plan. B) Or just increase the speed of one of the last reps. 20x400m @ 10k -> 16x400m @10k + 4x400m @ 3k 8x1k @ 15k -> 5x1k @ 15k + 2x1k @ 5k + 1k @ 15k C) or replace one of the sessions with hill reps D) Replace some sessions with races or time trials Personally I think option B) or D) are best, but the truth is this: Speed work only matters if you have a shot of winning the race, so why bother if you cant hang with the lead pack for the first 3/4 of the race. First you must be aerobic fit and that is done by milage, tempo and treshold running and this is what this method does. I am sure Vo2 max , hill sprints and plyometric jumps are great, but I am just a middle aged overweight hobby jogger trying to break 38min in the 10k, speed is just not my limiting factor.",

The main takeaway for me is how it's easy to stay fresh and rinse and repeat , along with when you breakthrough just a mild increase of intensity and go again. I would agree with others who have mentioned it being simple yet complicated all at the same time in a way. I think once you get what is happening here and collecting that low hanging fruit as others have described it, suddenly it all clicks into place and you can stick to it and have faith in the process. I can see how it would be tempting to get greedy and pushing for more. But I will sit firmly in the place of others who have mentioned , not really changing things up whilst the gains are there. Honestly, legendary thread and thanks to sirpoc obviously but all others who have contributed, made spreadsheets, provided their own feedback.",

    "message": "Running all 7 days. Workouts are 3*2.8km 5*1.5km 8*1km I find these workouts roughly fit into the suggested times. I just prefer running distance, it just seems to work better mentally for me. Absolutely doesn't really matter I feel, run fixed distance or time. The nice thing about distance is as you get fitter, just tag on another 100m working up to full mille, or maybe full 3km repeats. Maybe my OCD but there's a nice neatness to it as well. Rather than running time and ending up with 2.87km or whatever. 40 mins easy 3 other days and then usually a 70-75 minute longer run. This all averages out most weeks to 5.5 hours. I'm looking at the slow build like sirpoc. Maybe then I will start adding to the easy days. Then, that gives you room to add on to the workouts. The 75/25 \"green\" ratio someone made the spreadsheet for on Strava, seems the perfect balance to me. For cross reference, I was already running 5-6 hours for a lot of the last 7 years. But , continual breakdowns with a month off here and there , or feeling burnt out has always hampered me sticking to anything. This is by far the longest I have ever felt like that training is going OK, or that I don't need to change anything up , or having hit the proverbial brick wall. I should also mention, apart from the 7 minute PB in the Half, I have also taken 80 for seconds off my 5k. My 5k was always a bit stronger than my half on paper, so I've definitely seen less improvement % wise there, but now my times are much closer to being in line with each other.",

I am 42 and have followed the sirpoc™ method (hope the trolls enjoy that one!) for 41 weeks and counting now. I got on this thread early as it sounded too good to be true but there was enough testimony for me to give it a shot. I'm training 6.5 hours a week, also adapted it like the dude to scale down. Schedule mostly looks the same as his, but I am using time with 10*3, 5*6 and 3*10. I will add, I have added in strides on two of the four easy days. Whether that is important or not, I don't believe so. I tweaked a hamstring playing cricket and left the strides out for 7 weeks in the middle and I still did a big PB at 5k at the end of that time. Easy runs, I used the guide suggested and just have HR on my heat unit and make sure I don't go over 70% max HR. Don't pay attention to anything else. For reference, I have never been able to get to 6 hours training, I've always broken down way before getting to that point. Similar experience to everyone else? I can maybe follow a Daniel's plan for 12-15 weeks and then it just all seems to fall apart. There's often some aggressive easy running or speedwork that just finishes me off. If I was younger, I suspect I could handle this type of training more This method, I haven't had a break and still going strong and feel fresher. Sirpoc said something that stuck with me on Strava. \" I think this is the key to understanding it. It's basically given us all a perfect balance between getting enough stimulus without feeling too overloaded or breaking down. This as a consequence let's training load keep rising and rising probably past where most of us have ever got to before. This is my 5k Progression: I have tried to race/parkrun/time trial once a month. January (just before I started): 20:13 February : 20:19 (this was a couple of weeks or so in) March: 20:13 (I think this was maybe 6-7 weeks in) April: 19:56 May: 19:45 (lifetime pb 19:31) June: Too hot July: 18:56 (biggest jump even with the gap and lifetime pb) August : 18:44 September: No 5k but ran a HM PB of 1:24:02 October: 18:15 and scraped home at the end of last week in 2:57:58 for the FM. My 8th full, previous best was 3:10:44 and more out of line with my 5k at the time. My big take is that I am significantly aerobically stronger training like this, in fact hugely so. Picking off the easy gains time and time again. I doubt I will change anything up for now as I'm convinced there is still some untapped aerobic engine to release. Ultimately, this is why for the hobby jogger level this is probably the best as it allows for the consistency to untap that aerobic engine which is definitely your biggest value for money yoi can spend your training on. Anyway I've lurker here for a long time and have lurked on the excellent Strava group and just thought since it's been close to a year , at least one person might benefit from my thoughts! Before anyone adds anything, I'm not fast and this isn't a humble brag post! I just hope it helps someone else if they are on the fence about if this is for them or too good to be true. All the same worries I had!",

    "message": "My take from all of this thread is without wanting to come on here and sound like Coggan with specificity earlier in the thread......\"consistency, consistency consistency\" is the key here. This is not super hard, but it's also not easy either. It's that margin in between where you are doing more and increasing overall strain and load, but it's never too much that to becomes too much or you break down. Ultimately, this is where the average HJ'r fails and then the cycle repeats. I think that's why on the thread and on the big Strava group we see the ones who have had the biggest success are the ones who have stuck to it as close as possible and not tried to get greedy for want of a better phrase and push it on with vo2 work, hills , 300s on the track. Suddenly then, there becomes a question of \"is this sustainable?\" Or it certainly becomes more difficult to stick to the 7 days schedule laid out here. I do believe there is a large chunk of 18-22 min runners who have probably stalled and this would be a way to almost cheat and increase load. Don't forget, sirpoc himself i believe spoke about frustrations of no longer being able to push past a mid to high 18 without feeling beat up or breaking down and got stuck in the same vicious cycle we probably are all familiar with to a point. Ultimately that is what can or will happen when you are trying to force and push speed when you have this large aerobic void.",

Very interesting kicking up the long run duration as well, seems like he is able to handle the extra load well based on his recent PR! Want to hear if anyone else has started slightly modifying this schedule with some success (and in keeping with the core principles). For example, I still do three 30-36min threshold sessions (Tues/Thurs/Sun) but fit one session into my 90min long run so that I can do a light hill sprint session (~2 sets, 4-5 reps) on Saturday that over time doesn't leave me too sore/tired for threshold the following day. Dropped my mile time by 10 seconds recently doing this, and has helped me progress the intensity of my threshold effort (same effort, just happens to be a bit faster) too it seems. 5k pace feels much easier on race day (also PR'd by 20 seconds).

He sometimes touches this maybe by the end of the last rep for a minute or two, but certainly not always Look look at his HR in 10*1k WAY above threshold classic 'pace' at the weekend , but I think HR topped out around 175 by rep 10. It's all about pace versus duration. I think that's what he has worked out as almost a cheat code to keep a remarkable run of training just keeping going over and over again. This seems to have been adapted for himself, combining a lot of different methods through trial and error. If you take his Vdot threshold, that's around 3:19-3:20. Yet he can easily complete 10*1k in 3:12-13 average without probably ever going over threshold. It would be nice to hear from him with regards as to how easy this felt or how many more reps he could do on top of the 10? IMO this would be a good clue as to how hard this really is for him. What stuck me was the explanation I think he wrote on Strava. This is MORE aggressive than doubles, but still on the cautious side. You are trying to get as much as you can out on just a single session as opposed to doubles, but also making sure you don't get burnt, playing with fire and that you can still run and complete a workout again in 48 hours. It's a highwire act that requires real discipline and understanding of what the bigger picture is. I imagineas you get way more experienced training like this, you can get closer to looking over the edge into the abyss but never falling into that slope of no return. Whereas starting out, it makes sense to just very much stay on the cautious side until you get a grip and handle on things. I was incredibly sceptical myself of this approach and thread earlier in the year but having seen genuine actual improvement , especially in the 5k-HM range for so many people, it's become hard to ignore to be honest. If you aren't considering this at some point as an older time crunched runner, you are probably on the wrong path. Does it work for everyone? Clearly not. As a blanket approach across the board? I'm not sure there is likely something that would suit or benefit a larger percentage of runners out there at the moment.",

I think this is why the thread stays strong and won't even let the trolls like lexel destroy it, it comes back to being full of hundreds of amazing posters and probably the biggest gathering of useful information to the generic hobby jogger as you will find online. Almost the new hobby joggers training bible. If there was anyone who has been running maybe 6-18 months who wanted to know where to go next, this is the place. But what I find really interesting, are the posters here or the guys on Strava who have been running years who have copied or applied a version of this to themselves and then still improved. That's what takes things from just useful, to remarkable. What is interesting with regards to sirpoc and what he's doing now, is how he's still managing to find ways to increase load. I'm guessing he's still increasing his CTL and he just did a pretty decent 5k PR, which shows me that you can still even progress with this if you put your mind to it, even when you get to a very high level and keeping the principles the same, but just finding that time or room to train that little bit more.

    "message": "I have read only the abstract of the paper, as it is not for free available. The standard calculation to estimate CV is the 2 parameter approach. It is recommended to have at least 3 better 4 time-trials. However, some studies show that also 2 TTs gave a good result (2 TTs at the edge of the hyperbolic function, short-long). In my %CV thread, i presented a CV estimation based only on a 5k result, based on IAAF score tables, which seems to work well too. As we train here below (sub) CV, we do not need W’/D’ (in this 2-paramter approach). (this parameter has indeed problems) I mentioned the 4th performance parameter, which is durability (additional to LT%, VO2max, CR). Any VT/LT/CV 'threshold' shall not be seen as a constant parameter, it is a variable. CV as well as LT2 goes down it we get tired (i provided some papers here in the past) . And there are day to day variations. Intensities above CV seems to increase recovery time significant. Therefore, to stay ‘safely’ below CV, you need some kind of safety gap below CV. This gap is individual, but 95%CV is a good starting point (for the method mentioned herein). The big advantage of CV is, that you do not need neither a step graded lactate testing, where you have to select between 20+ methods to estimate LT2, nor a spiroergometry. A spiroergometry is still considered the gold standard as you know, but it is quite expensive and complex. Also measurement tolerance is there. However, a spiroergometry is the only way to measure VO2max and CR, so it has its value. CV is available for the broad mass, without any complex measurements and devices, that gives a big plus for it. It also provides the possibility to rank athletes based on CV for a HS or whatever, as it is a great performance index.",

August 5km pace + 25-45 seconds. End of October did run another 5km and this was even bit slower than August. But as with you I also feeld fitter currently, just was not able to translate this to good 5km race. Did more research. What I did find on various pages was that for slower runners (>40 minutes for 10km) threshold pace seems to be closer to 10km race pace rather than half marathon pace. So since two weeks I run all my workouts just a little bit faster, more like August 5km pace + 10-20 seconds. The workouts are surpisingly as doable as with the slightly slower pace and also the days inbetween feeling the same. I had a couple of good parkruns (not run all-out, so not sure about race pace) now as well. Will continue now with the new paces. That feels just very good now. Still do not have a lactate meter at hand and will continue with paces for the moment. My feeling says I did good progress - numbers will follow (hopefully). My main event upcoming is a half marathon in April, and in case I might still not progress for the 5k might still be beneficial for that event then.",

He has followed exactly the same routine more or less as sirpoc and has improved a huge amount in national XC race I myself also go to. There are real people, in the real world, actually training like this now. Of course it won't work for everyone. But what does? Yet if you were going to the shop to buy a training program for your hobby jogger lifestyle and were hoping the first one fits you......well this is almost certainly the most likely to give you the biggest gains over a year, versus any other plan you plugged into your life. Also. Why are we even debating if 1:10 flat is fast? Give me a freaking break. It's probably in the top 0.1% of people running HMs let alone % wise of the masters category. Nobody was calling KI not impressive when the thread started and he was mentioned. In fact people have even been saying lately don't look at sirpoc, look how KI has added in speedwork and he is a faster guy! Cmon, look at the times. We weren't disrespecting KI for only running 1:13, we were marvelling.

To further your argument, the shorter reps probably require a faster pace to reach the same lactate, even with proportional rest(?) which obviously means more mechanical stress on the body. In cycling, injury prevention is so much less of a focus that they can reach high levels of muscular fatigue and not be in danger of injury. To be clear, I don't think anybody's sure of exactly what causes running injury, but the fatigue model makes sense to me: your stabilizer muscles get tired/big muscles get lazy and then you start moving in suboptimal ways. I guess the impact thing just doesn't make sense to me: maybe it's the fatigue (that possibly comes with the prolonged muscular stress) that is dentrimental or injury-promoting, especially in running.",

If you consider the eccentric spring like effects in running motion versus the simple concentric pedal strokes in cycling. Using shorter intervals you train at paces much closer/relevant to racing paces. This helps to further develop running economy/efficiency. This gives you an additional benefit over just the benefit in terms of time spent with LT at 2-4mmol. In very long intervals your form is much more likely to suffer negating these benefits, and probably increasing increasing injury risk as stabiliser muscles etc fatigue. The rests are short enough that your lactate doesn't drop a huge amount yet it gives these a minute for your muscles to recover for the next rep. That'd be my guess at least.",

Originally, though, it wasn't 2 x 20 minutes, but 2 x 10 miles at ~TT pace (i.e., essentially all-out, given that it was training and you had to \"back it up\" with a second run ala a Bonnivelle Sal Flats record attempt). The short break in between is because there was a small town with a 4-way stop sign at the end of that stretch of road near where I grew up, and I have never been one to blow through stop signs on my bike. So, I would shut it down, proceed through the intersection normally, get a drink of water, turn around, tighten my toe straps (this was ~50 years ago), take a deep breath, and get back to work. It only became 2 x 20 minutes after I started doing much of training indoors in graduate school, due to time constraints.",

You mentioned something way back when lexel linked his universal running formula, vLT = %LT * VO2max / Cr, that when you account for “threshold” the variation one sees in observed vs predicted speed doesn’t require the trendy physiological resilience variable. Is that in reference to the “threshold” value one would use in a speed-duration model (whether using a bi-exponential, piecewise, or other unpublished model) to estimate performance over a broad time range? Is the implication that when you personalize such a model for an athlete, the variation these studies are reporting in parameters like peak VO2 or Cr, in a pre and post fatigued state, are already captured by the relationship between the parameters in the model and thus wouldn't contribute significantly to the variance in the model? Translating that to practical terms, by training \"correctly\" for your event you are already taking care of physiological resilience and that will display itself in your speed-duration curve?",

Then nothing. Then suddenly an absolute huge gain unexpectedly around another 4 weeks after that. Then it all started flowing and after 8 months I'm in lifetime shape and still gaining at 43 years old. That seems to be the pattern, give or take , for a lot of people. It takes a lot of guts or courage I guess to absolutely go all in with this method when you don't see that initial gain. I've suspected it's because using let's say a textbook Daniel's plan, you can overload and get quite good gains. But likely you will need a break after a block and some decent downtime. Whereas this is more linear, you just build and build and build. So you can grow fitness at a slow rate in comparison, but when you scale it up to 50 weeks instead of like 10 with a traditional plan, suddenly you have a huge amount more training load stored in the bank with never needing a rest, taper etc. I don't think it's much more complicated than that, going on how some of the much smarter guys than me on here or Strava have tried to explain it.",

And this is where I’m trying to find some clarity regarding how resilience/durability is framed (and modeled). In terms of your two points, based on two of the more prominent articles I’ve read on it (Andy Jones and John Davis): 1. They seem to be suggesting the variance in an individuals decay from their max steady-state speed (so whether CS, MLSS, etc.) should be added to the Joyner Model? However, what I don’t quite understand is 1) why the Joyner model is the reference point and 2) the linear decay you reference (btw, I assume you’re talking about how it appears on a semi-log plot where the decay is modeled logarithmically and the decay factor is about -0.06 +/-, right?) in a more robust model, seems to already be capturing what they are referring to as physiological resilience, no? 2. Assuming what I said in point 1 is a fair representation of the process, one could improve their resilience/durability, without increasing their threshold simply by not falling off as much at the longer events, no? For instance, same threshold basis but seeing an improvement in half marathon and marathon. Jones seems to see that as resilience improving where as you’re saying that’s just realizing what you were physiologically capable of already, since there was no change in the model parameters other than the decay factor (that’s how I refer to the term in my approach but I think it’s stamina in training peaks)? Is that how you are viewing it and thus why you feel there is not a need for such a concept/variable?",

That is, I am not that the terminal decline of the intensity-duration relationship truly significantly varies between individuals.* If you model this as an exponential decay (linear on a semi log plot), this is the same as saying that the \"Reigel exponent\" is the same for every athlete. Consider the following: Assume you have two athletes with absolutely identical running speeds at maximal metabolic state. For athlete A, though, this speed is overestimated by 1%, whereas for athlete B it is underestimated by 1%, just due to normal measurement error/variability in testing. If you then threw them on the treadmill and asked them to run as long as possible at any speed slower than this, athlete B will be able to exercise about 15% longer, simply due to the way small differences in intensity translate into much larger differences in duration as a result of the shallow slope of this relationship in this region. IOW, despite identical muscular metabolic fitness, athlete B will *appear* to have greater \"durability\", but in fact this is just due to measurement error.",

A lot of studies consider the time above 90% VO2max (i.e. above CV!) important to trigger significant adaptations (e.g for VO2max), especially for well trained athletes. We train here below CV and it can be expected that VO2max will not be improved too much, if at all. CR (cost of running) might be significantly improved (as mentioned). LT% might be improved as well, if you are relatively new to running or you came from another sport (e.g. Sirpoc). Additional i also believe durability will be improved with this training. The brain can't be considered as a perfect system (in contrast to what some scientist (wrongly) assume) and learns. I had to interrupt this training (i do it similar but lactate guided with cycling) for just one week (holiday) and had significant performance losses after that. Not explainable by a lost of VO2max or different muscle structure, likely because of just muscle coordination ...",

He improved each time. He will likely like 99% of us hobbyists run out of time before he reaches his peak or plateaus. Say he gets to 8 hours a week but that's the max he can train, obviously he will stagnate. But I don't think it's the purely sub threshold work in itself, that would limit further growth. Obviously if we are talking 15 hours a week, it's a different story. There might be only a fraction of room there for aerobic development if any. Then you might need to put the cherry on top of the cake. I think it's way too easy to get swept up into this or that , when likely for a significantly big majority of runners out there, if they copied sirpoc and Kristoffer Ingebrigtsen they would more than likely improve in the medium to long term. On another note, does anyone know what has happened to KI? I know a few times people joked in the Kerr/Wightman v Jakob days that the true Brit versus Norway matchup we need is sirpoc v K. Ingebrigtsen! But sirpoc seems to have mostly stuck to the method almost religiously and is quite a bit faster than KI now? Seems like ever since KI went for some hills or maybe some X factor injuries have crept in? I never quite understood why he did that as it seemed like he was still improving.",

Caveat though, they used race times up to 15km in the calculation, which will (and I know you know this) significantly alter the CS from its “true” value. The reality is more like ~92% CS for the marathon and ~96% CS for a half marathon, based on a dataset of elite athletes. So, a SIGNIFICANT time difference. I’m still a bit unsure why they did this since there was no pre-defined data set they had to use and, presumably, they would know taking times from outside the “optimal” time range on the longer end (i.e. 10km and 15km race times) would lead to a slower CS? I’ve since read this figure cited in a few mainstream articles on CS and resilience/durability, such as one from Alex Hutchinson.

They both seem to be working off the Joyner model, vLT = %LT * VO2max / CR. Davis in particular had more running specific studies, along with some nice graphical representations of the data from the studies. One of which modeled the decay in running economy over the course of a marathon. What I found curious about this was that he modeled it linearly, so decay is occurring from the start of the race. Seeing how one can observe a VO2 steady state in loads of MLSS test data, and those carry on for 30 minutes, I thought it curious that at marathon pace, you’d expect a decline in running economy so soon (assuming an even race pace)? Would it be more accurate to expect a delayed decay over the course of a marathon, where the decay doesn’t start until later in the race and then rises steadily to the end? Either way, he is advocating for the resilience/durability variable to represent the variation in decay that leads to different race results between individuals with the same starting VO2max, %LT, and CR, as predicted by the Joyner model.",

I started running around this time 3 years ago post lockdown and my first run was a 24 flat 5k TT. I quickly got to around 20, progressed to a mid 19 and that was that – or so I thought. Was running I guess half structured, some Daniels I and R pace combined with the usual straight tempo, long run etc. Then found this thread about 9 months ago and things have really clicked into place after a couple of years of frustration. Things with the method laid out here just make so much sense for my lifestyle, my age, my ability and the realistic number of hours I have available. I have tried to follow the method via sirpoc strava logs as close as possible, which seems to be paying off. I just ran 17:22 at my latest parkrun 2 weeks ago. I don’t know why it seems to be working. I’m just here to report that I am delighted it has! So just a huge thanks for him for decided to post in the first place. I am sure I am not the only one who feels this way! Its strange, as an ex UK ‘tester’ on the old timetrial forum years ago, it seems odd to see sirpoc and Coggan here, two of the main characters of the past. One of the reasons I was so sold on this method (I can only assume it’s the same sirpoc!) is that the guy was way ahead of the curve and someone lots of guys I know looked to when it came to aerodynamics. For the geeks here his CDA numbers are almost unbelievable. So, I figured although training physiology is a totally different thing, he’s probably still someone to latch onto something that works. I actually know the Hard2find , Coggan stuff is probably found overkill for most people. But I actually don’t mind it and enjoy picking up on the few snippets I do understand! The thread can be whatever it wants to be. As simple as sirpoc has made things or we can debate the ‘why’ with the guys who really want to get into the weeds. Coggan in the past can be a good poster, as he has shown, I just hope he doesn’t get fixated in debating Lexels nonsense as he did TrevTheRev. Obviously lexel talks pure nonsense, but giving him air time is the only real thing that derails the thread in my opinion. Also, I very much enjoy Unbelief and his quips. Very funny when he pops up.

IOW, if, and only, whole body lactate content is neither increasing nor decreasing is this conditional fulfilled. As for CP, it will always be just below the lowest intensity used to calculate it (at least if you ignore any mathematical noise/modeling error). Using tests of longer duration (e.g., out to 30 minutes), as Monod himself originally recommended, is still testing above the estimated value. TL,DR: Conceptually, MLSS and CP are precisely the same thing. Any difference difference between them therefore is entirely due to precisely how they are quantified. This is why studies comparing them are never going to be very impactful. Instead, people interested in such issues should be focused on *why* there is non-linear/threshold-like response in the first place. *That* is a far more important and interesting question.",

Along with this comes their preferred nomenclature for exercise intensity \"domains\" (e.g., \"severe\"). To establish the primacy of this idea, it is necessary to \"dis\" MLSS, as well as ignore the limitations of CP (i.e., test duration and model choice) as well as prior research (including some of their own). They also have to choose to ignore (or simply don't realize) that if CP is supposed to represent the intensity at which all ATP is produced aerobically, a steady state in whole body VO2 (even if delayed) is only a necessary but not a sufficient condition - whole body lactate (and high energy phosphate, but that's minor) content must also be constant as well. Thus, *by their very own definition*, CP and MLSS are exactly the same thing! This is why I say that they can only differ if one (or both) has been incorrectly operationalized. For folks new to the field, this probably all seems a bit confusing... aren't people like Jones and Poole \"big names\"? How could they be wrong? If you actually read the literature, though, you will find that only recently has CP testing started to coalesce around tests of a particular duration - previously, things were much more variable (with tests that are even shorter than 2-15 min too often being used, despite Monod - again, himself - pointing out that this results in overestimation of the true maximal metabolic steady state). As well, the lack of widespread acceptance of this \"grand unifying theory\" is illustrated by the recent ACSM/Australian position stand on terminology to describe exercise intensity, which rejected the new \"domain\" in names in favor of classical descriptors (\"moderate\", \"high\"). But hey, this is just me sitting on the sidelines observing the field (for 50 years now). I'm not an applied sports scientist and don't study CP, MLSS, VO2 kinetics, etc.",

Furthermore, why does it even matter in the first place? Agreement or lack thereof really says nothing about the underlying physiology, which is far more interesting and important. As I tell my students, ask good questions, attack with rigor. IMO, comparing CP vs. MLSS vs VT vs. NIRS vs. iEMG vs. epinephrine vs. what have you fails the first test, hands down. (Thanks for indulging my ranting.)",

The mathematical models to estimate them can be discussed, but that’s likely too much here. Those mathematical models have to be used at least in a correct way, which is not the case in some papers! How they call the ‘zones’, I do not care, that is quite irrelevant. The name ‘Severe’ looks like a marketing name to me, like Tinman. The standard definition of MLSS, I call it now MLSS (trad) can be adopted, as it is arbitrary. Again the parameters 10min, 30min and 1mmol (@ unbelieve) are random numbers and they have no special physiological meaning. Someone could say use 1.5mmol, or 2mmol, or 1.25mmol, or 15min to 30min, or 20min to 40min, or whatever you get the idea. It’s all arbitrary. Also lactate levels cannot be transferred from athlete to athlete. It’s not difficult to realize that this MLSS definition is a severe problem (haha). Neither CP nor MLSS needs to be dropped. Scientists can even keep up the MLSS (trad). MLSS (trad) is then typically 7-9% lower as CV, FTP about 5% lower -> theory and practice. And now i drop the bomb, the link between your Coggan power zones and CP: Level 4: Lactate Threshold: 91-105% FTP; Level 5: VO2max 106-120% FTP And exactly around 105-106% FTP is CP, which is exatcly the boarder between your level 4 and 5. So you already used CP as a boarder. You are welcome, I find this quite funny. Source:",

However, what is the value of identifying this rather obscure point? Contrary to Jones's assertions, it is clearly above the point at which metabolic control is lost. As for my training levels (not zones), all of the cut points are arbitrary (since everything resides on a continuum). The fact that level 4 ends about where the \"new\" CP falls is therefore coincidental.",

Furthermore, even when present the impact on endurance performance ability (which seems to be constrained to about the 2-10 minute performance \"window\") is actually rather small, i.e., 2% or so. In contrast, the effects on maximal neuromuscular power are ~3x as large. This is why we have focused our studies in patients with HF and ostensibly healthy older (i.e., 65-79 y old) individuals, both of whom exhibit reduced muscle power and diminished NO bioavailability. There really isn't any evidence that \"loading\" is helpful. In fact, we have evidence that repeated dosing (for 2 wk) may actually reduce the ability of your oral bacteria to convert nitrate to nitrite. As an athlete, you're therefore best off saving it for race day (although again, it may not help, and of course you want to test it in training, so, e.g., you don't miss your start while in the Porta-potty peeing/pooping pink).

Second, this is a simple but surprisingly tiresome method due to the high-end aerobic volume per session (30+ minutes for me). In absence of a taper, there were some weeks where race effort felt horrible, likely because I was underestimating how much energy I needed to replenish and underfueled. Then I played around with nutrition (ate more per day, bumped up carbs) and started feeling amazing. Long story short, I could recover from workout to workout fine as the efforts aren't crazy demanding – but the energy demands from high volume work can sneak up on you, especially when you need some pop in the legs for an effort faster than sub-T.",

I used to run pretty high mileage, averaging over 70mpw for over a decade and peaks in triple digits. Since 2016 my running has been mostly downhill due to struggles with achilles issues. I had the full Galen Rupp surgery in Sept 2023 (achilles debridement and calcaneal osteotomy) and spent a year recovering and have only recently gotten my mileage to where I feel like I can do anything. The week of Dec 9th I ran 60 miles for the first time in years, for example. I have no imminent racing goals, and I don't expect I'll ever be in 2:39 marathon shape again. I ran a 10k turkey trot at 6:27 pace, so I am using that as my baseline. Let's see what happens over 2025. My first week using this approach. I ran each day Monday - Saturday. M: 6 miles at 8:48 pace T: 3 x 3k at 6:53 pace, 10 miles total with warm up and cool down W: 7 miles at 8:33 pace T: 5 x 2k at 6:44 pace, 10 miles total with warm up and cool down F: 7 miles at 8:32 pace S: 12 miles at 8:11 pace S: 90 minute easy spin, low Z2 So 52 miles of running.

If someone was coming from a relatively trained background and didn't want to necessarily run PRs, but wanted to put themselves in pretty good shape (with the possibility of shifting focus and increasing volume in the future): What are the downsides of JUST doing 3 sub-threshold efforts per week, or 2 and a LR? (aka no running recovery days)? I feel like Bakken might do something similar in retirment? I want to experiment a bit this winter and spring, but coaching track in the afternoon leaves me only mornings, and while I actually enjoy Sub-T on the treadmill, I dread easy runs and have other things I'd rather focus on. Many here seem really adamant about only a certain percentage (25-30%) of volume being sub-T, but is this because it will (understandably) lead to a lack of improvement without easy volume? Or because somehow the workouts might fry you without the recovery/hormonal effect of easy running? I really just want to enjoy training and stay in 17:00 5k shape, which is a little over 2 mins off my PR. I was able to do this in the Fall with a quality LR, a sub-T effort and a Daniels style 5k paced workout and not much else. If my easy days are OFF of running instead, does anyone have any insight or experience with this leading to injury or burnout? Thanks!",

    "message": "Likely, without easy running to buffer up the sub-T workouts, it becomes harder to improve since you lose a big element of gaining aerobic ability. You might end up detraining a little before hitting some 3 sub-T workout equilibrium. But the 25-30% volume being sub-T rule is just a rule to allow for even distribution of volume as you add more and more past your baseline. Basically, if you plan on adding significant volume, it can't all be sub-T or you'll burn out, but it shouldn't all be easy since then you're missing out on some gains. 25-30% sub-T adding is the sweet spot. But if your volume comes from sub-T already, there's no problem if you're resting instead of doing easy runs, except that it's less aerobic management training. But like I said above, do account for a little bit of detraining only running 3 times a day compared to more full weeks. So it might mean your sub-T workouts get slower for a while before settling. Definitely don't try to stick to same sub-T paces as when you're running a lot more because as your fitness falls a bit it might not be sub-T anymore and then all that injury risk yada yada grows bigger.",

    "message": "Week 3 and 4 update here. Some thoughts: Toward the end of week 4 my heart rate has dropped a bit at the paces I've been running. I know that sometimes that can be a sign of excessive fatigue and in the past I have had that happen. This is a different type, I feel stronger than 4 weeks ago. I don't want to assign that to the training alone, I am using this method as I rebuild from a few subpar years and one year of almost no running due to achilles surgery. So it could just be fitness returning as well. But I do think for me there is value in doing this with conservative pacing. Week 3 I ran 58.5 miles. I did SubT workouts on Tues, Thurs and Saturday (4 x 10min at 6:54, 5 x 8min at 6:49 and 10x4min at 6:35). Sunday I ran my usual trail look for 13.2 miles and came to the conclusion that for a guy pushing 47, running a longish run the day after quality isn't really feasible anymore. So I pared back to 2 SubT workouts but lengthened them a bit. Week 4 had SubT workouts on Tuesday and Friday (4x10min at 6:35 and 5x10min at 6:54). Sunday had a long run of 14.2 miles with about 1400 feet of elevation gain. 60 miles for the week. I need to do some sort of race or time trial to see how I'm progressing. I also signed up for a half marathon on March 2. Low expectations, lifetime best of 1:17 in 2011 at age 33. Really just hoping to be around lower than 1:30 and expect a bit higher than 1:25.",

I guess the thinking would be that 40-50 min of this work in one session might be pushing the envelope a bit, although it seems you’re lowering the pace a bit to achieve that. I’ve had a similar predicament, because I have to take one easy day and a day off a week right next to one another. Means that I either have to cram a very hilly long run and a SubT session next to one another, or I need to sacrifice a session. I’ve started putting the SubT session into the long run, and do the timed intervals uphill. Maybe give that a try?",

Curious if this plan is as solid as say, a comparable pfitz block 2. How should I structure my LR? Right now I'm doing a big chunk easy + big chunk sub-MP, and small amount at MP. I will grow the run from 2:00 -> 3:00, increasing the ratio of Sub MP:Easy portion. By the end of the block it will be a pretty good marathon sim ~23mi 3. Should I mix and match or pick a favorite of 10x1k vs 5x2k vs 3x3k? I think the longer intervals are a bit easier to dial effort in and keep it steady. Was going to mix it up for variety though. 4.

Previously had been running or following other plans for close to a decade. Sirpoc's training is out there. It's not a secret. His performances in his 40s speak for themselves and testiment to this system. There are dozens of testimonies in this thread of people who have improved more or less copying him. Hundreds on Strava. A guy posted in fantastic detail the other day on Reddit how he went from almost 7 years as a stagnated 20 min guy well into his 40s to breaking 18 after 9 months of this and still improving, even down to the Mile. Question is, why wouldn't anyone consider training like this? Not even should they. Also, no disrespect to Kristoffer, but sirpoc is at another level to him. Sure, he has Henrik coaching him. But I'm just as likely to follow the guy who has had truly remarkable results and as have others following his lead than someone who really is scaling down what he knows from elite to hobby jogger Would a pro train like this? No, obviously not. Are most of us pros? Hell no. It's all very well looking at the training plans of olympic runners, but the reality is we should be shaped by guys who have life balances, stresses, jobs, other things going on in life like a sirpoc. Also, I think there is something new here. Find me one other training program that doesn't have speed or vo2 work built in, no strides, no straight tempos and basically just two paces of running. Pretty much none and none with this level of success. He's probably given as much to the LRC community for free than almost anyone I can ever remember. If respecting or being inspired by that makes me a loser, give me a T-shirt now. The great thing about this these and why it is so damn good is even when the usual guys try and troll it or make it toxic, the positive still shines through.

Nobody has tried to sell anything, nobody has asked for anything back in return and other members of the community like Hard2find have clearly teamed up with sirpoc to provide invaluable tools that you would usually find behind a pay wall.

I have been coming on LR message boards for many years to read. I'm now 50 and anyone who has been here a while will likely be as beat up by the place, skeptical and probably down right miserable by a lot of the experience. I don't believe in miracle cures. I don't believe in miracle training. In fact, quite frankly I had this thread down as a bunch of idiots fumbling around in the dark. But hey, don't judge me that's how LR makes you feel! But then, you actually take a step back and think 'Hmmm, there is a lot of actual positivity here' So, my background, I ran in school. I was average. Very average. Gave up, came back as a married, hobby guy at 36. I ran 19:11 for the 5k and a 1:28 half at 38. I stumbled around that level for a while, mainly using a mixture on and off of various new ideas coming out, or simply going back to more traditional methods from various cookie cutter plans you will find in the usual literature. I actually scraped an 18:56 at 41 from a day where it all came together. Anyway, come around this time last year, this thread I guess was in its peak. I seemed to tick all the boxes. My best was long behind me, I was running around 6 hours a week still with various plans but I was going nowhere. Was running around 21:30. Tbh, I was pretty happy with that at nearly 50. But decided, why the hell not try this new craze. Wow, did I make the right decision! I read most of this thread through twice. To make sure I hadn't missed or messed up any of the interpretation. Set out to just start out right away: My initial impressions were I must be missing something, at the end of my first week it felt way too easy. Almost like a recovery week from what I was used to. The workouts felt like I could have easily done more reps although I did start cautious and that's not a feeling I have had in my previous years very often! I was already doing 6 hours so I basically just replicated the classic here, 3*10, 6*5 and 10*3. And I just went on .....and on.....and on. Suddenly week 9 I noticed things were significantly faster. I jumped in a 5k , ran 20:50. Just kept going. 3 easy runs and the long run plus the same workouts. On and on and on. Boring. Very boring. I hopped in another 5k around week 16. 20:21. You see the pattern. On and on and on. Week 21. Ran 20 flat. You know the pattern, same week in week out. This was by far the fastest I had run in a very long time. Anyway, I was building to a half, this was around week 28. I ran 19:32 in a random 5k I jumped in , them the week after I broke 1:30 with a 1:29 flat in a HM. As time as gone on, I kept improving, when, remarkably just before Christmas I broke my best from when I was 41, a couple of days after my 50th birthday . I ran 18:29 and was blown away by it. To have a sense of achievement at this age just blows my mind. The key to this is the consistency. It has allowed me to just keep going, doing my own thing. Whilst fellow old friends of mine are training themselves into a black hole of fatigue, I am staring into said black hole but never faling in. Anyway, last Sunday I broke 1:25 and ran 1:23:55 in a half. Cleaning up on my new age category of 50+ afterwards much to my delight! I have managed to increase load as that time has gone on. From hovering around 6 hours to managing sometimes to squeeze out around 7. Running everyday I can, as suggested. Paces from the original posts way back now, seem pretty good. Maybe I had to slow them a bit for the first month or so, but quite quickly I feel into the Goldilocks zone sirpoc84 suggests. Easy runs are easy, just cap at 70% HR and whatever will be will be. Probably the most difficult aspect of this is working out a balance between how much you have improved, versus where to go next in terms of paces, more time training to squeeze some more load out. It seems madness to me now I was doing 200-400 repeats to give me a speed boost in a 5k. I mean really. I was a 21 min guy. This is simply madness when you think of it. Absolutely the limiting factor is my aerobic engine was running out of fuel wah before any speed I had in my legs was usual. I just wanted to share this and hope it might inspire someone else to never give up on improving based on this thread. I thank those who posted their own experiences here that helped me decide to dive head first in myself. Highly recommend the Strava group by the way, all the main characters of the thread post there regularly and as others have said, it's not behind any paywall which I find remarkable.

Perhaps I'm a wimp, or too mentally weak or simply bored with repeat speed workouts at my older age. Are we supposed to build up to these workouts? And they're sub threshold right? Not threshold? I'm fast twitch so perhaps lacking aerobically. My legs feel trashed the next day after these workouts. No way I could tolerate 3 workouts a week. If you do a long run & 3 workouts a week that only gives you 1 easy day between. Plus a workout day & long run likely fall back to back. In my opinion, that's intense for a has been hobby jogger like me. I used the Norwegian Singles Calculator using my most recent 5k time of 18:39 (course was accurate). Also used the suggested pace times below to compare. I run 45 miles a week, so am allowed 4 miles of sub threshold work, but haven't been able to tolerate near that much. Easy runs are around 8:30 pace, (which isn't fun at all going that slow, except for days after workouts where I'd rather not be running at all because again my legs are dead). Track's snow covered & it's nothing but hills here so it's hard to find a somewhat flat stretch to do these workouts. (more excuses, I know) Subthreshold workout recommendations: 1K reps (usually 8-12 x 1K) with 60\" rest at 10mi to 15K pace (For me that'd be 7 @6:23 mile pace) 2K reps (usually 4-6 x 2K) with 60\" rest at HM pace (for me 3 @6:32 mile) 3k reps (usually 3 x 3K) with 60\" rest at 30K pace (for me that’d be 2 @6:43) What effort are people rating these workouts? I'd probably rate these 8.5-9/10 whereas other training plans I'd rate workouts 7/10. I'm not getting a lot of cardiac drift so perhaps they're still in the sub threshold HR category. I've sorta been following the Tinman method where a rough guideline is CV workout of 5x1k at 6:20 pace, 60 sec jog recover, plus 5 x 200 meter at 1600m pace with 200 jog. Other workout is 3 mile tempo at 5k+ 60 sec, so 7 min pace. This method feels way easier than the above workouts, which makes me wonder if I'm doing it all wrong.",

Or your volume is too high. Or these paces are wrong for you. But ultimately you shouldn’t be doing this training “on tired legs”. Not that you should be fully tapered and fresh for every workout. But if you were suddenly forced to run a race on the day of any given workout, you should be able to do a pretty good job. Therefore doing 1/3 to 1/2 of the volume of the race AND breaking that up with rests should be pretty easy. Also just come to grips with a slower easy pace.

Since the idea is to do workouts that DON'T feel too hard, I would suggest you do 5 x 2 @ MP or even slower. After all, the pace we run in a marathon is after a taper, fully carb-loaded and with new super shoes. That same pace feels a lot harder untapered in regular running shoes and after a hard day's work !

I'm going tweak my schedule around & try doing a workout on a weekend & I bet it'll be a lot easier. I think I'm going to forget about trying to squeeze 3 workouts in a week until winter is over &/or work calms down. Had someone quit at work again so I'm working extra with lots of walking & time on my feet. May see if I can rearrange my schedule to start work a little later & do workout before work instead when legs are fresh. @Xlzyt Race was done in an older pair of Brooks Hyperions. Workouts are usually done in a trainer (Ghost, Novablast, or Nimbus). I have done a couple 1k repeats in the Hyperion & those workouts did seem easier. Good point about the shoes. Hills make it tough & you're right I should adjust pace accordingly. I try to look at total net +/- elevation for a rep to find stretches that are fairly even. @Charlesvdw Ya, I'm at the wrong side of 40 too. Closer to 50 than I am 40. I like your idea of using MP for the 2k workouts instead of HM pace, so workouts don't feel too hard. Think I read somewhere threshold is a state, not a pace so I likely need to back off the pace or not focus on the pace as much.",

Somewhere in the thread, someone - maybe sirpoc himself - described the intensity of these workouts as the top end of moderate on Strava's scale, hard. You should finish feeling like you did a workout, but not like you went all out. Keep that feeling in mind and slow things down or reduce the volume. Your rest intervals are shorter than they have to be. 2 minutes rest is specified for 3K reps, so I let the rest interval range from 1-2 minutes depending on rep length. One of the ways I've progressed these workouts is by shortening the rests as I get fitter. At the beginning I needed extra rest. Instead of trying to hit particular paces from the start, I look at pace as a function of recovery: What pace can I sustain for 1 mile (for example) and be ready for another rep after 1 minute of rest? How many mile reps can I do before going over the edge from moderate to hard? And most importantly: What pace and volume can I do and still recover by the time the next workout comes along?",

Remember it’s all about building manageable increasing load to receive the consistent gains. once the load starts to plateau you can increase the pace or rep count and as you get closer the option to move from time to distance i personally prefer 10 x 3 min closer to 10k pace, and 6 x 6 mins at HM pace and 3 x 12 mins between 30k/20mi pace",

    "message": "I definitely don’t find these workouts as easy as old_skool describes them, but nowhere near as difficult as they seem to be for you. And I‘m fairly sure I’ve been pushing the pace a bit too much on a couple of them… Do you have another longer race to compare to or calculate from? You’re taking the fastest listed paces for your 18:39 — your 1km reps could be more like 6:39 pace and be in the pace span, but keep in mind that the 5km is still under 20 minutes. It’s a highly aerobic race, but short enough that your ability to burn energy above threshold before fatigue (W' in cyclist jargon), which varies significantly between athletes, still plays a significant role. You also say you’re more of a fast twitch athlete. These pace bounds probably work for most people, but some people will be outliers too. I‘d say set a *fastest* pace of 6:40/mile for the 1km repeats for you. Start more like 7min/mile pace and work your way down to 6:40 pace by the end. See how that feels. Once you’ve gotten used to training around and below your threshold, you can do a lot based on feel. Not sure just how hilly the area you’re training in is, but the variation between my intervals based on hills is significant, i.e. over a min/mile pace difference. I cannot use pace in those circumstances whatsoever. In your case, I would also switch to using time and other metrics (power, GAP, HR) or just running on feel. Basically, you should scale these workouts such that doing three per week is doable — that’s largely the point of the system! And I‘d like to hammer home the point above about slowing your easy pace. If you’re doing a more traditional base phase, running high Z2 might make sense sometimes. Here, it’s best just to really go easy. Try to make your routes interesting so you aren’t bored!",

Maybe easy is the wrong phrase, but if you have been doing stuff regular like 5*1k at paces a lot of coaches prescribe, Daniels straight T paces runs or anything else we are familiar with, they feel significantly easier to me, in comparison. I've heard sirpoc say the same, about this RPE in the simplified 1-10 scale. I don't dread the next session, having finished vo2 work or hills, I quite often never wanted to think about running for a couple of days, let alone actually have to force myself to ru. Training like this is more like you just tick off the session, move on to easy the next day and more than be ready to go again and 'just do the job'. Once you get into it like that, day on day, week on week it just all kind of makes sense compared to what I had been doing before. The lightbulb moment, so to speak.",

First of all my race was like a one a million coming together of feeling super good, having the right people to run with, and wearing super shoes. It was dumb to expect I could run that well 3 days a week, after work, not in super shoes, not caffeinated to the gills. Plus going from 1 workout a week, to 3 was hard. All that’s to say even though the workouts are comparatively easy, it still takes your body a little getting used to.

    "message": "The comparison with EIM has been made before, but the similarities are mostly superficial. Look at the basic philosophy in a nutshell: The goal of SubT is to improve aerobic fitness by maximizing training load per week, which for time-constrained amateurs targeting 5K-HM races is best accomplished with 3 SubT workouts, a moderate long run, and some very easy runs. Compare that with EIM: The goal is to develop a reactive stride by doing only workouts that include faster-pace intervals in some form. Easy running is harmful to this process and should be avoided. EIM will work for all athletes, from novice to pro, training for 800m-marathon. If you can't do EIM workouts every day, it's better to cross train. So yeah, some of the workouts are vaguely similar, but the two approaches are attempting to accomplish entirely different things in completely different ways. And it shows in how SubT thinks easy runs are great, while EIM thinks they're bad. There are only moderate-effort days in EIM but no easy days, while in SubT there are only moderate-effort weeks. SubT has worked well for me (although I won't have another chance to race for months yet). I gave the EIM a serious try a few years ago and it was a disaster for me.",

You think you know what you know, that's fine. But most training programs you are familiar with are probably sub optimal for most guys and gals on limited hours a week, compared to this. Good luck finding another thread with one of these new crazes as you call it, with as high a strike rate and positive feedback. Some guys are fast, some guys are not. That's not the point. If you can actually see through and past what you think you know, you will see how many people this has allowed to breakthrough a stagnation and really push on. Here and on Strava look at so many guys in the 19-22 min range in particular, who are now well under sub 18 or even better. This is after years and years of training in most cases. Not just new runners, making instant gains. That, to me, is what takes this from a good idea to potentially one you could hang your hat on and say it's probably the best option for most? Just because coaching has been done a certain way , certainly since Daniel's has popularised mass market coaching, doesn't mean it's the best way. Lots of sports in recent years have been doing sub optimal things in their coaching , scouting of talent etc mostly out of habit or just because they weren't aware of a better way. Or a particular way just stuck. For real, I have ran many Daniel's plan in my 20 years training. Tried others, always went back to him. Is it probably the best one on the table now? I would argue not. If I had someone come to me and say what is my best option as a hobby jogger who is prepared to run almost every day, I would almost certainly link them to this thread.

    "message": "I can add an anecdote / data point for this style of training. I’m mid 40s M, averaging 100 km / week on singles. Have typically followed Pfitzinger training plans for the last few years (rotating 5/10/15 km type training plans). To be fair they have worked OK for me, have seen steady improvement. Was targeting a 10 mile race, so thought I would trial this type of training. Also fulfils the specificity argument as I run 10 miles in under an hour, so good threshold kind of pace - hence plenty of work around threshold can’t be a bad thing. Simply rotated 5x 6 mins, 8x 1 km and 20x 400m workouts every third day for the last few months. Having said that, depending how I’m feeling I still like longer progression runs and tempo runs so still getting a balanced diet so to speak. I found the workouts manageable, obviously easier than some of the Pfitzinger VO2max workouts which can leave me a bit dead. Always tried to keep my HR not getting much higher than 85-87% of max. Took 2 mins off my 10 mile time. Whether that can be wholly attributed to this style of training, not sure (I’ve had a very nice steady 6 months of 100 km/week which can’t be a bad thing), but I found it OK and easy to follow - and felt less beat up than Pfitzinger. I’m generally sceptical that any training plan is massively efficacious compared to any other, but I certainly didn’t regress using this approach. I did a 5 km TT a month or so ago and my pace had improved slightly, so still some gains even though I wasn’t doing anything specific at that kind of pace for quite a while. I do have my own prejudice that you can gain some psychological strength from really hard workouts, which this style of training doesn’t really get you to. That might just be my own mental myth. I’ll probably continue using approach for a little while longer.",

That is it. The lack of specificity is what allows that. Event specificity is what virtually all other training programs, include - yet it's probably the least value for money training for a hobby jogger. The vast majority of people who have stuck to this, have improved. Two mins off your 10 PB into your 40s is huge. People who try and get cute with the absolute basics have tended to be the ones chasing their tail and something goes wrong, when training to the spirit of this thread. Let's not forget sirpoc broke 19 off a couple of years normal, textbook running training. But the fatigue, the impact and the need for down weeks was probably overall what capped him at a certain point. To put my flag in the ground, I was one of the many near the start of the thess, totally unsold on this and thinking pure nonsense. Well over a year later, clearly I have to hold up my hands and say I was wrong, based on my own experiences and the literally hundreds of others.",

    "message": "Post your training if you want better advice. Perceived effort doesn't matter. It might be helpful to drop the \"easy\" label and think of it as your non-workout pace. Staying under 70% MHR is a good guide for keeping this pace at an optimal fatigue/benefit ratio. It should feel easy, but it's also possible to go unnecessarily fast with it still feeling easy, thus the cap on the HR as a guide. If your workout paces are correct but you're finding your overall training too easy, you can progress by adding volume. Add volume to your workouts as well as increase overall mileage. If you're already using all your allotted running time, take volume away from warmup and cooldown to increase the volume at workout paces. And if it's still too easy, then only do two of these workouts a week and have your third workout be a more intense race-specific workout. Maintaining a certain easy run pace out of fear that any slower will be ineffective has been a mistake made by countless runners. You are primarily recovering on non-workout days, not building fitness. But putting all that time in at 60-70% MHR in fact does increase your performance significantly. There's a mountain of evidence for this. And those benefits are not increased by much (some of them are even hindered) when you run those days at a higher intensity (say 70-75% MHR). But there are big downsides.",

I tend to think about it like this: Obviously if someone is limited by durability and strength training helps them do more running it's a good thing, but if someone is limited by time it's probably a poor trade to give up some of their limited running to lifting. The big things on injury prevention are sleep, nutrition, stress management, and proper training load. If you have a specific issue get a custom plan from a PT or otherwise educate yourself on how to address that specific issue. Of all the studies I looked at that say strength training improves running economy, performance, whatever... I haven't really seen a strong body of evidence that reallocating running time for lifting time makes already fit people better. Like most exercise phys research in general the majority of studies tended to be some version of \"we made some average people actually train hard and it made them slightly less average\". The research that was with high-level athletes tends to be adding it to an existing program, but also doesn't explore just making them run more.

Like you can’t get fit enough to front run and break the pack so it’s better to develop a kick than go all-in on time trial type racing. imo you can get quite a lot done in 10-20mins a week so we are talking only 1-3 fewer mpw. Even just hill sprints would help a lot, which technically don’t take any time at all as you integrate them into your cooldown (assuming you have a convenient hill).

    "message": "To add, I found the Steve Magness videos on sprint training for endurance runners and on tension to be helpful. I'd recommend watching them from start to finish since key points are spread throughout. But one thing I'd emphasize is how strength training and sprinting are much easier to maintain than to build. So it may be a little disruptive to the training recommended by this thread, but that's only when you're building. Maintaining it is so much easier than building, such that it is almost certainly time-efficient once you're in maintenace mode. The same can be said for people who are perpetually tight: stretching is a big time commitment to make progress but maintaining it is very easy once you've reached a comfortable level. And the last similar thing that comes to mind is body composition. Spend time working on it once to get it in a good spot and then maintaining it is easy and will benefit you for years. The relevance of the tension video here is that the ways to increase tension could be quite tiring if you never do any strength or sprint training. But if you have developed your strength and speed, then you can do effective strength and speed work without incurring significant fatigue. Also, these subthreshold workouts and slow easy runs will only lower tension. Some runners could find that the training makes them feel flat, making the tension methods even more important and yet harder to do simultaneously, as they'll be a new stimulus that's extra fatiguing. Not a good spot to be in, but easy to fix. Maybe I'm getting the wrong impression but it's disappointing that people seem to be a bit close-minded about including other things and defensive about the training method here. I don't think strength and sprint work are threatening to the method. Just a tiny bit of periodization or a one-time \"special block\" to develop them and then reduce them 75% to maintenance mode are some really promising optimizations / tweaks imo. Practically speaking, I'd at least wager that combining plyos/strength/sprinting all into one exercise: 6-8s hill sprints, is worth the time. On the other hand, I'd wager that doing heavy compound lifts, as John Whelan suggests, is inefficient -- very fatiguing for not a lot of relevance to endurance running. In fact the elites who do lift heavy are nowadays reducing the range of motion of lifts to make them more targeted and running-specific and less fatiguing.",

In most cases thats probably a good thing -we may not want the extra shock overload, but I still don't want to be dismissive of non-running plyometrics altogether! With lifting you lose a lot specificity and time, and may add some soreness but you can still get some benefits while eliminating impact altogether. I've found you keep the volume really low 3-4x <5 reps and consistently do it 2-3x the week the fatigue is not terrible, so it's just a matter of time commitment.

Until I found this thread. What sirpoc laid out, made sense in theory, after all it wasn't just what to do, but why. Many thanks to him by the way, whatever anyone things the dude has given more to hobby joggers in my opinion, than 99% of these influencers with thousands of disciples. I found this thread in February 2024, so my journey is coming close to a year. I am a mediocre runner. My biggest achievement was winning my local parkrun, if that is even a thing. I ran 19:23 and I am 35 years old. I got there through a lot of hard work. A mixture of classic stuff like Daniel's 2Q plans and specific strength sessions, got me to around 19:05. I certainly felt stronger with some lifting etc. This was all around 2023. Back to February 2024 and like I mentioned, something just struck me with all the knowledge here. I've seen other posts saying the same, so I think there's something about the lay out etc and sirpoc's explanations that resonates with people, the 'Ah that is me' when he describes the struggles. I started off with good fitness it must be said, with 5 years in the bank and a near 19 flat. Not good but obviously not terrible. So I basically jumped straight in. The paces were very near what I could cope with, although I was a little thrown off with how easy the easy runs were and that took a lot of time to adjust to compared to other programs. The main issue I noticed after a few weeks, was how hard it was to do some basic lifting and stregth work and fit in 3 sub threshold workouts. In fact, it was near on impossible. My legs hurt couldn't cope with the demands. The strength stuff was merely standard stuff you will see in a lot of classic coaching books and manuals. I jumped on the side of the fence that I would just throw the lifting and stregth work out of the window and purely went 4x easy and 3 x sub threshold and nothing else, not even strides. Oh boy did I make the right choice. By Christmas parkrun, I ran 17:22. The progress was pretty steady. I had a breakthrough around week 7 in training which translated to a PB in week 9. It's been pretty steady since. I was have dropped maybe 10 seconds on average each parkrun. Yes, I am racing maybe once maybe 3-4 weeks. But I was doing that for the previous 5 years so it's not like suddenly that's the big factor. Another big note here, is initially I was doing 6 hours a week for most of that time, while I was doing 6 hours a week for most of this, I have slowly been able to ramp it up to 7. This is the first time in my running life I have got anywhere near 7 on a week by week basis and I feel a ton better than I did on my previous 6. Here is the interesting bit. I added strides back in and some lifting around the new year. Suddenly, I really started to struggle. After the first week or so, I assumed it would just take time to get back into it, but if anything it got worse. My legs just felt like lead when it came to sub threshold days. Anyway, the last week or so I have given back up strides and anything you could consider strength work and almost straight away within a few days it suddenly felt like 4x easy and 3x sub threshold was definitely doable again. I'm not sure if there's a conclusion here, but I just thought I would post based on the fact it seems to be a big debate of what to include on top. My legs probably actually felt stronger and less fatigued in general with the long period of nothing but running. I actually only got back into it because of a couple of videos I saw from some old school coaches and it convinced me now with the biggest base I have ever had, to add that work back in. Anyway guys, thanks for the amazing thread, all the big contributions, the Strava group and thanks to sirpoc for his original posts. Whatever motivated him to do so, I'm glad you did! Keeping an eye out for if he ever does a marathon?! I believe the London Championship entry list went out today. Is he on it? Oh, I honestly agree it would be kind of cool for a KI and sirpoc show down! I agree I would rather see that than half the garbage being put out on YouTube and Instagram these days by running channels!",

    "message": "I'd expect it to be a struggle to integrate it and for other training to suffer temporarily. Whether the other training suffers permanently is the unknown. I think some amount must be possible but what's the correct amount to achieve some benefit without compromising your important sessions? But my philosophy is why bother until you've plateaued? You can keep building volume until you're using all your allotted time for training. Then you can keep increasing paces until they plateau. Only then are you really forced to find out where the bottleneck is and if it's something you can improve. If it ever does come to that, I think you could at least maintain aerobic fitness while you work on speed, and then at some point speed/strength becomes less fatiguing (it's not a new stimulus anymore) and you also do it less (because you're just maintaining now, not building) and so you can reinstate your normal training. Or you could take another approach and introduce the smallest amounts of speed/strength possible such that they couldn't possibly have a significant effect. 1 stride that turns into 2 strides, strides slowly turn to 90% sprinting, and those turn into a single hill sprint, which turns into 2 hill sprints, etc. I think there's some individual physiology at play here too, whether genetic or from training history. Some people will have an easier time building strength and speed standards while others will have an easier time hitting higher volumes of slower running. I personally have a lot easier time sprinting than most distance runners and a lot harder time building volume. So I'm aware it might not be the best general advice to tell people to do hill sprints like it's so easy. Just focusing on fatigue to benefit ratio, if a certain kind of training is more or less fatiguing for an individual, then they should take advantage of it or avoid it. You see the most variety in 800m runners. I don't think the low mileage speedster 800 runners should try to build to 80mpw as a long term goal to reach their full potential. And the 80mpw guys should not drop mileage to try to hit the same 400m time as the speedsters. But I still think that, ultimately, if we're talking about the most time-efficient training or if we're talking about time-unlimited training, then strides/strength/plyos/sprinting make it in there in some form. I think current consensus is strides and hill sprints are the most effective and you can integrate strides into easy runs so there's no time lost or mileage sacrificed. I think no one recommends doing jog recoveries for true hill sprints (I always hear walk back and standing recovery) but I'd imagine that jogging the recoveries is not that bad. Or you sacrifice some time/mileage for the sake of standing recoveries.",

    "message": "Hey man, greet post. I'm glad someone has mentioned this and thanks for sharing your experience. I have sort of found the same. I trained with Pftiz plan and incorporated gym strength sessions. I thought they were what kept me strong and relatively injury free. But also found the same when going to the sirpoc NSM method. The leg strength days actually became an issue in the sense my legs felt just horrible to have to do that + what is effectively 3 Q workouts a week. Man, I felt bad like the whole method was impossible with the gym day as well. Someone posted here about sirpoc himself not doing strides or any strength work and i was floored by it. I thought I would experiment , dropped it and after that month my legs finally didn't feel beat up. I would say now, I have way less niggles. Like a lot of others, I have obviously improved my PBs quite a bit. I read a lot of studies about strength, I'm not convinced anymore it's a good use of a hobby joggers time, especially as there's pretty big debate into what actually is strength and what is useful. A lot are intervention studies on really low mileage guys who aren't even really runners or a lack on research into how strong and resistant one can get by just running lots, near the limit, but getting still enough recover like this method. Maybe the third session a week is almost covering up or building that resilience dedicated gym sessions might bring. Who knows.",

It's rare, but does happen. HR data can indicate this is the case as well, I've seen him run 168-169 as max HR for the day even on the last rep is which is going to be way below his LTHR and that matches with M pace for the workout as well. I wonder if this is a deliberate ploy of his? The understanding of when things are in a little bit of the harder stage than need me and it's cutely eased off as a result. Would be interesting to know. He's clearly given us the general gist of the system but there are definitely little nuances that he is making the most out of that we aren't privvy to.",

Week 6 I took Monday off and ran 55 miles for the week. I had a little bit of calf tightness so I pulled the mileage back a bit early in the week and was fine by the end of the week. SubT of 5x10min at 6:53pace and 6x8min at 6:47 pace. Long run was a hilly trail 13.2 miler. Have a race coming up on 2/15 which will be my first race since before the haglunds/debridement surgery.

If you are 1:15 ish, 75 mins is probably enough. But, a 2 hour HM runner needs to almost treat it like M training. The huge success of this method for hobby joggers, means this method here, Reddit and Strava has blown up. The big problem seems to be however, people don't understand it . Like, for real. I've seen people quoting sirpoc on stuff the dude ever ever said. Or now there's guys telling 18-20 min 5k runners what they lack is speed. The fact that anyone can even say that shows 1. They haven't used the method themselves or 2. They don't get it. Quite quickly you are just sliding into a Daniel's 2Q plans or the like if you think like that. I initially thought this idea was difficult to get wrong. But actually, the inherent greed of runners for pushing themselves in training, or the inherent need to look good on Strava workouts etc. is where people are messing up. The basics are the basics, but the complicated stuff is understanding what load is and how it can be quantified in a repeated manner. It was relatively new to me, but I'm glad I took the time to understand what is going on under the hood here. Without calling anyone out, as I've been in the Strava group , I think there were a couple of guys who maybe didn't go all in on this method, but now have and I'm always looking out for their progress and it's really good to see. But, I think it takes everyone a while to really fully understand what they are doing. With that, it comes back to who to listen to. The usual suspects from this group I believe are admins of the group? All of who, are the ones I look out for on Strava posts. Sirpoc chirps in plenty and it's always worth listening to what he says along with the others. I think really it would be great to pin sirpoc down to what he still believes, what holds true from the thread originally etc as I think for someone coming in now, there's a lot of hot air and nonsense that has nothing to do with the method or people are adding stuff in that will distort results, or coming full circle to the point I'm replying to, totally forgetting there's a different between a hobby jogger running 2 hours HM or sirpoc running 1:09.",

If I was him I would take a podcast invite or write a book himself or something, it's grown so much there probably needs a definitive recap, as I agree there is a wild amount and ton of misinformation. Maybe less on here but Strava, Reddit and other social media is a mess with this NSM buzzword but not even reading the orgins of this thread! There's even a decent amount of folk who still think 18- 22 min runners are lacking speed for the 5k and that's what they are lacking. Which is again pretty wild if you look at how for all the testimonials we have had here + sirpoc ridiculously good progress at 40+ years old, obviously isn't the case.

    "message": "Marathoner here. I'm trying to transition my training to Norwegian singles and I'm wondering if I should do two or three sessions a week. Also wondering about combining a session with the long run. I've just come off some training that was almost the opposite of this training -- I was doing a hard session only once every 1-2 weeks. Everything else was easy jogging except some strides and hill sprints (these were also infrequent). I think this was the right thing for me at the time in order to build the strength I needed to survive the marathon at the pace that I already had the aerobic capacity to do. But I've got a long time (over 8 months) until my next race so I think it's right to train differently for a while. The point is I'm used to very infrequent workouts so this is a big change. I'd think 3 sessions is actually easier assuming you aren't overdoing them. But it could go bad really quickly if you are overdoing them. So I'm thinking 3 sessions and very conservative on the paces for 3-4 weeks until I feel really confident I'm not overtraining (also keeping any other training like strength/speed very light until I get this established). And I like the idea of doing 10min intervals at 30k/MP and having that be part of the long run (having a longer warmup and cooldown than the other sessions). Is that sensible or is there a strong recommendation to have a long run that's pure easy mileage and keep the sessions separate? Is that supposed to be easier?",

Like, what gain does someone have to fake a whole method and strava training account? His race results are definitely real, you can find them on websites, so he is elaborately just faking training, just cause? He gains nothing from all this work. Also, who says doing 3 sub-threshold workouts a week and aerobic easy running isn't VO2 stimulus? Gutting VO2Max workouts and running at faster than 5k pace is not the only way to get VO2Max stimulus... Obviously you improve baseline VO2Max slowly but surely doing any kind of other aerobic work. Specific VO2Max workouts are just stuffing big stimulus into one single session at the cost of recovery time. So what's there not to believe that you slowly improve all aspects of running fitness by just stacking workouts and volume and following this method? No one here is saying it's the fastest or most effective method, but it is certainly safe, mundane, routine and easy to do, and slowly but surely does work for a super wide general population of all speeds, with many success stories, making it viable to try out for anyone just running to improve. Lowkey you're the one that doesn't seem like a real person lmao. \"I can't see how SirPoc hasn't got injured following a training plan so dumb\" - What, so you'd expect less injury risk if he was doing weekly reps at faster than mile pace and VO2Max workouts, with strides? I dunno about you, but the faster and more straining something is slightly higher chance of injury. I don't see how 3 chill workouts and easy pace for everything else is injury risking. Not quick improvement, sure, but no one ever preaches this method for fast results. \"I don't think anyone could have trained the same way for so long and made progress\" - He has made progress he can train this way for so long. He can train this way for so long he hasn't got injured. He hasn't got injured this method is safer and easier and more mundane than incorporating speed, VO2Max, and getting too excited. Slow and steady. How can't you understand this basic logic flow?",

All running works, it’s just a matter of what you’re optimizing for given your constraints (time, injury, goals, recoverability, load etc). If you want to get faster in 4 weeks hard sessions will certainly do that. If you want to see what your aerobic potential is over years, the name of the game is to consistently build and stack load (volume x intensity) without getting injured. That’s all that’s happening here, safe consistent training. Enough intensity to be time efficient, but not so hard that you sacrifice recoverability and can’t do 3 sessions with a long run in a week.",

    "message": "The two sides of this VO2/specificity debate are mostly just talking past each other. The details of any training scheme emerge from the application of general principles to specific constraints and goals. Part of understanding any training method is understanding the parameters of the athlete it is designed for. There is a lot of useless debate that stems from people not understanding or disregarding these parameters. People are trying to compare or modify pieces of this method to different methods that have a different set of constraints and goals -they are trying to plant different crops in the wrong growing conditions. To the point ningkaiyang is making: this method is giving up some aspects of hypothetically optimal training in favor of the more practical reality that a lot of rec runners are operating within. It's building in a some common sense and risk mitigation into the method itself. Yes if we properly execute and recover from more specificity/intensity we will see more improvement, but the reality is that as intensity increases it's easier to screw something up. The mechanical and metabolic strain scales non-linearly. We're looking at marginal gains vs shrinking a margin of error. Expanding the crop analogy: A lot of training plans are asking people to grow a lot of different crops, including some plants that come from tropical environments regardless of the growing conditions they are working with. We'll have a more varied diet but theres a good chance some of your crops fail and we don't get as much food in the long run. This method flips that and asks \"how do we reliably grow the most food in the in the soil and climate we're already working with?\" The diet might be more boring but at least we'll be well fed. There's still room for variety, maybe we add some native berries (strides), we can seasonly rotate crops (using shorter or longer threshold rep schemes to target different paces), but the point is that we fit to the ecosystem we're in. Okay not sure where I'm going with this but I think ya'll get the point. I am curious though. What is the fastest results anyone here is aware of with strict adherence to this method or similar? Doesn't need to be the exact scheme but at least threshold-ish only workouts, no X-factor/VO2max/whatever, only specificity comes from racing. Strides are allowed.",

Sirpoc will break 15/31 soon, but his potential is probably on a different level to most of us and may well run sub 2:25 in the marathon. There's another American masters, sub 16. He also trains the same almost exclusively in the sirpoc method. Which, in my opinion, it should be called. Norwegian Singles method is too broad and people are way over complicating it. If we just name it after sirpoc, we can just say 'go look at his Strava' and honestly within 5 mins scrolling you will have worked out the fundamentals. I think the remarkable thing about this method though is how many testimonials we have seen from 19-22 min runners. Who have broke through in some cases half a decade or more of stagnation training the more traditional methods, growing many different crops in your analogy. Some guys have been training for 5-10 years and suddenly this has allowed them to increase load in a way they never ever have been able to prescribe before, knocking minutes off even 5k times. That is what is quite striking, almost shocking when you see past who is fastest and look at the at times absolutely staggering progress some are making. There was a guy who posted on Reddit in depth and it was a really cool, informative post. Whilst he isn't fast in the bigger picture, his improvement is almost unbelievable. The good thing about Strava, is we can see this progress from guys in the group day to day. Obviously, the group is grown but as others have said, if you know who to follow it becomes less noisy.",

If you are going to go all in on this method though, one race in the grand scheme is just a blip. You are looking to build more and more and more. Yes, you might not perfectly built for that 5k, but long term you just kept building with a tiny taper. Sure, you might give up a few seconds without that specific race preparation or sharpening, but you are also still back to it a day or so later and you are still in the same phase of just being able to just continue to do the same thing, over and over. The next 5k or the one after that, you have continued to build more and not interrupt training with doing anything sub optimal, for the long term build. The increase in speed will naturally just come with the increase in pushing up the threshold from below. If you look at some of the stuff sirpoc has shared on Strava, it's fascinating. The CTL to performance graph was insanely insightful and has certainly worked out the way he's intended. I will say though, it takes a huge step out of ones comfort zone and is a huge leap of faith for people, including myself, who are used to those 8, 12, 16 week builds to something specific. The other advantage is whilst you never completely master one distance, you are pretty darn good across a broad range. I think there's a huge argument that's the main benefit here for the hobbyist and I don't think that's mentioned enough. It's hard to get your head around. But if you are thinking ahead to just one particular race, a more traditional build is perfectly fine, but there's only so many times you can do that without having those peaks and troughs way too familiar to most us. That to me, seems to be the trap a lot of people have gotten into and why, as questioned above, so many people seem to have broken through a plateau when really trying to do this style of training as close to 1:1 as originally laid out as possible. I'll put myself in the group a lot have others have admitted, my skeptical nature was pretty high on this, which turned to curiosity. That in turn, turned to why not. Now, I'm unashamedly in the camp of thinking, for th average hobby jogger this is probably the absolute smartest way to train. Someone questioned above, why would one train like this so boring and long term? I can only give my opinion. But I never in my life came close to my modest target of breaking 36. I think a lot of people's focus is the 5k but mine has always been 10k. I had pretty much tried all avenues and always got a mid 36 at best. I've been on the Strava group and followed everything as closely as I can. I ran 34.26 last weekend. I can't lie, I had a boring 7 months of a slow, steady but very doable build . But, who cares? I was also really bored of missing my target and now more than happy to train like this if I can finally smash through and put long term running goals to bed!",

OK, sure, some 5k sharpening might get you a few seconds here or there one specific race, but it's very marginal for anyone hobby jogging , that is it even worth the risk to just suddenly throw it in? Likely you are giving up some of the sub threshold workouts, which are still the low hanging fruit. Even 3 times a year you then have then almost 3 specific builds with different levels of sharpening, tapering. There's literally nothing wrong with that, but again I think you are trying to pick and choose or cut and paste the bits of this you want, which we have seen usually doesn't work out as well.

Last year I pulled a peak week of 3x1600m @ 4:58, then next day 10mi steady @ 5:52, next day 8x400 @ 64, then 5x800 @ 2:20 in back to back days no resting, thinking I would get faster because I was following a training plan created by some pro runner in the 1970s - what a waste of all that grit haha. I'd built up to 70mpw during base and then dropped it to like 45mpw to handle the brunt of back-to-back workouts in my training plan. I hit some impressive ones early on like 5x1600m @ 5:05 at 10k effort, but then as season went later I was struggling more and more and racing my workouts harder and harder. There was also other stupid stuff like 2x2400m @ sub 5:00 pace, then the next day 3mi 'tempo' at 5:15. I was really racing each one, balls to the wall, looking back on it. 4 days (insanely short taper lol) after my peak week of 4 back to back workouts, I time trialled a 9:50 3200m and a week later a 4:36 1600m, and then my season was completely spent. NOT what I was looking for, 7 months of training harder than I did in high school just to not PR (even tho could've been in better shape cause time trials vs racing, it wasn't that much better) and based on what could have been possible based on some of the workouts, had I spaced them out and recovered reasonably. So I guess I'm hoping to join the list of success stories this season and get up there and prove this method doesn't only work for old guys lol. Maybe break 32min in the track 10k. I reckon speed and VO2max aren't really my problem with the anaerobic workouts I was handling last year, and working my threshold entirely for a few months will provide good results. Although, since I'll be traveling for a large bit over summer, I will attempt to do a peak build with some 10k-specific work in the four weeks before one final race and a few weeks off, which will definitely deviate from SirPoc method. But keeping to the SirPoc's ideals, my key workouts/X-factors will basically be once every two-three weeks once I'm a few months into only sub-T training, replacing the third sub-T session maybe shortening the long run to facilitate recovery. I'm also doing a few relaxed 200s on full recovery after some threshold workouts to stay in touch with speed. But I've been following the 3 sub-T workouts and running slow on easy days to a tee so far and I'm 3 weeks into the season (after 2 weeks off) at my lifetime highest mileage (75mpw third week back is a lil crazy haha) and it's feeling sustainable, so I'm going to buckle up at 60-70s and see where this leads me. 🙏",

My marathon variation is to keep with 2 x sub T during the week (10x3 and 5x6) but double up on the long runs at the weekend with the first run including a subT effort. On Saturday I will do the 3x10 as part of a long run. Progressively increase length of the long run and when within the run I will do the 3x10. So at the start of the cycle it will be at the start of the run (like a normal session) and toward the end of cycle at the end of the run I plan on the run being 2.5hrs max, or I will go with a straight steady effort (load should be about the same regardless without burning me out) and then on the Sunday keep a 90mins 65%mas max run. This is the closest I can think to getting loading in the right ballpark without over doing it, depending on how I go I might add marathon effort for longer workout eg 3x15 (which sirpoc said left him tired) so trial and error on my part. it may work, it may not work but the best thing about this method if I find I’m not hitting the regularly workout it’s very easy to see and then make adjustments without compromising you training block.",

No. All he’s done is make the long run 2 hours long (instead of 90 min) and one of the sub-t workouts longer (4 x 10 min instead of 3 x 10 min).",

I have pb'd across the board, but under no illusions the stable diet with a long run of just 75 mins will do anything but cause trouble for the marathon. However, sirpoc maybe himself might be our best bet? Usually he is the one in all of this one step ahead, despite all the noise everyone else makes. I can only assume he is not now running 2 hour runs for the sake of it and he is in the championship race for London? I would imagine maybe 8-10 weeks out we might see some different workouts.",

    "message": "That's not what anyone has said at all I don't think, in terms of don't do 5k pace if you want to. But the point being, the reason nobody really needs to sharpen or taper for a 5k at the level of folks in this thread. They are still aerobically underdeveloped and improving. 5k pace work is just an unnecessary complication to the mix, for relatively little short term gain, in the face of the long term bigger picture. I would also disagree. The general consensus is more traditional training plans for users of this thread, whilst they provide some results, the blocky nature of them with these builds and peaks, ends up with a very choppy level of fitness after and you just repeat and get back to the same point after another block. I know I was trained as much as the coaches I had or training plans given would allow. I was absolutely fried and at the limit of what my body could usually cope with. 90% of stuff coaches have used with me, are no more or less than classic training with a staple of harder easy runs, 5k repeats and straight tempos. Quite simply, it was too much to recover from on a full time job, life etc. I agree, it certainly made me not well trained for the previous 6.5 years before switching to this. But, that's more a fault of what the traditional coaching and running methods, not my execution of it. I did everything I was told. It's of course not this method in itself that has made me go from 19:21 to 17xx, it's understanding some of mainstream coaching for hobby joggers doesn't make sense. I don't think I've seen sirpoc claim once, there is any particular secret to sub threshold in itself . Yet, what he has laid out seems to be a pretty darn good approach if you want to just plug and play and have a really good shot at finally getting past that peak, build, burnout and do it all over again. I'll take the maybe giving up a few seconds in not sharpening up my first 5k of the season for the fact I know now from last year, sticking to this after the first race that sharpening will be there anyway and i can also just continue to log my miles, do my runs, week in, week out. 5k through HM we don't even massively need to debate at this point. As above, the marathon is worth a real look into and someone really following through with this but also honest pacing on race day. I've seen a couple of people train like this on Strava, but then suicide race pacing means we have no idea if their plan worked or not? There's obviously an argument for shorter track sharpening, especially the mile. But there was an excellent post on Reddit by a guy who followed this with zero speedwork and smashed his mile PB on just this. In fact, his mile was run very close to his 5k and his mile PB had a better VDOT score than his 5k!!",

    "message": "This would be the most surprising thing to me if such little adjustment of the method can lead to a successful marathon. I think it could for some individuals but there are many runners who smoothly transition from 5k/10k to HM, but when they transition to the full marathon they find out it's a different beast. I think I'll start with the normal method, having the 3 sessions distinct from the long run, and I'll keep the long run relatively short by marathon standards. But I think the right thing to do is to eventually combine the long run with the long intervals and make it a 2 hour day. And then personally, in the final stretch before the race, I'd like to do some long MP tempos. So that week would start like normal with two threshold sessions, then instead of doing the normal 3rd session, you turn it into a long MP tempo instead. The following week you drop a threshold session and maybe reduce the other threshold session, just to be safe about recovery. I'd personally want to do 3 of those. 8-9 weeks out, 5-6 weeks out, and 2-3 weeks out. When you add up the time at pace, you'd still be getting in about the same. For example, if you are normally doing 4x10min that day and instead you do 80min continuous, you've done +40 than normal that day. Then you drop a threshold session afterwards to recover, so you get back to close to net 0. If you drop/reduce another session, only then are you negative in total time at workout pace. So for a traditional 2 marathons a year schedule (~26 weeks of training), you take 4 weeks recovery/easy, you have 13 weeks of grinding out the method, and at the end you have 9 weeks where you compromise the method a bit to work on race specificity and taper. 5k/10k runners get to just run more races for their specificity. Anyway I'll get to it and try to remember to report back at the end of the year. Good luck everyone.",

It should be pointed out that studies have been done where a training protocol is created that successfully raises vo2max but 5k race performance does not improve. And there are studies that were aiming to do something else (were not focused on vo2max) but included vo2max in the testing, like studies on plyometrics, where the control group improved vo2max but the experiment group did not, but the experiment group improved in race performance while the +vo2max group didn't (because the experiment improved something like Running Economy instead). It's been decades already that exercise scientists and top coaches have suspected/known that chasing vo2max gains is not the way to reach your full potential. Once it reaches a certain point, it's not very heavily tied to performance and is not a performance metric worth chasing. I think it was in a Steve Magness video I heard Paula Radcliffe's vo2max, which was tested a lot, did not change from her late teens to her peak. Even if you set her marathon aside, she also improved massively at 5k. edit: I wouldn't rule out that vo2max training is useful early on in one's career (although I wouldn't bet on it either). But when you look at an adult who has done years of vo2max training and plateaued, it should not be surprising that another kind of training shatters that plateau! It should be expected!",

Of course some people probably have better innate fatigue resilience due to biomechanics, muscle characteristics, whatever -so can bump up to the thon successfully without highly specific training where others might not.

The marathon is all about extension, so backing off on the paces to allow greater volume of work at the low end of LT2, even into LT1 territory, may be helpful if you're the sort of runner that underperforms in longer distances. Something like 3 quality runs and an easy long run, with the 3 quality sessions at 95%, 100% and 105% of marathon pace (which is pretty close to what NSA training looks like for the half marathon in relative terms) may help the more relevant part of the LT curve for the marathon?",

I am not currently nearly as fit as I was for my last “A” race and not nearly as fit as I expect to be when racing in late spring. I have vague goals in mind, but while they help motivate me to train each day, they have basically no bearing on what I’m running in training each day. Whether with this method or another, if I were to run a 1:30 half, I’d start the next phase of marathon training as a 1:30/3:10 runner, see if there’s improvement over the next several weeks to adjust paces, and find out as I near race day where in the 3:06-3:10 range my goal pace will be.",

    "message": "Not sirpoc either but you are way off the mark here my friend. You do not want to stay at the same CTL at all. Ever. Your goal should be to increase this as much as you can, even though you won't be increasing it much as this system is not promoting overload at all. It's not the perfect metric, but works well to measure against yourself as you are doing the same thing over and over. It's actually the opposite, your performance shouldn't plateau over a reasonable ish period, because you have increased load. If you think about it in terms of every 6-8 weeks, it'll give you an idea. Sirpoc shared something on Strava which was the absolute biggest eye opener to me, it was roughly linear and a graph of his CTL and 5k performance. It was cool to see, as it was over the around 2 straight years he's been training like this. Coggan gets a ton on internet forums and his stuff still works well, whilst he never intended any of this to be converted to rTSS etc. I can only imagine, someone like sirpoc who obviously knew how to make it work with power data, has adapted it well in my opinion to how it can be applied to a hobby jogger. It's also another reason for my money as to why you shouldn't deviate away too much from the paces sirpoc laid out. There's a corridor where rTSS seems to represent very well that he has hit upon. The harder runs , let's say a 5k pace is clearly underrepresent and it's harder than the rTSS model thinks. On the flip side, really easy running is probably easier than it represents. The big thing here though, is if you roughly stick to 75%-25% and split in the easy paces suggested and roughly around sub threshold paces suggested, even if the rTSS scores aren't exact, the repeatable nature will even out and you can compare apples and oranges with yourself. Say you throw in 5k repeats regular, you would have to keep doing them long term, as they will give you a far less rTSS score than you deserve. If it's not part of your regular schedule, over time it'll distort the data. But you also have to remember, the absolute CTL value is irrelevant to compare person to person. I went into this thinking it was pretty simple, but it's actually not as easy as you might think. If you have not got understanding how you can use all the data you can collect, you won't know where to go next. I've picked up a lot of what sirpoc has said on Strava lately. He's good at answering questions there, although I don't know how he has time, he gets so many!",

For people who know very little about CTL, it looks like Sirpoc has done the exact same thing for about a year and half or so, up until recently where he has increased the long run and changed 3 x 3200 to 4 x 3k. Other than that, he did 3 x 60 easy, 90 min long run, 3 x3200, 6 x 1600 and 10x1k. The paces changed as fitness improved but the number of hours remained pretty constant. Despite the hours remaining constant, the CTL was increasing, presumably due to pace increasing, as HR was about the same for the durations. His time at sub-threshold was actually decreasing over time, as the rep length remained the same but the paces got faster",

Sometimes around the 8 hour week now instead of 7 a year ago. This sounds like small change, but if you see the data he shared it all adds up to a mere CTL increase in a year of 10+ more. This sounds like not a lot, it isn't, but the performance also increase in that year in smooth fashion. Gains become harder to get for him the second year training like this.

    "message": "No this isn't true. I think this is where a lot of people are getting confused. It's a exponentially weighted average, about 90% over that time frame. But all the data you have ever put in, contributes to it, just the further you go back the less weight it carries. It takes a long time, but eventually for the most part your CTL will just become your TSS average for the previous 42 days. But imagine you started at zero, the way it works is let's say you did 100 TSS a day. After 42 days your CTL would be 63.7. It would take you 316 days to finally reach a rounded figure of 100 CTL. After that, your choices are do more intensity, do longer durations, or both. If you stick to 100 TSS at that point, in simplistic terms , then you have plataued. I've mentioned before, this is why the second year I trained like this, the gains have been harder to get. You have to be creative and try and do more. But still, essentially every session ever still contributes, it's just the stuff i did 2 years ago is now minuscule in the calculation. I will also add, it's probably only useful if you are trying to compare like for like. If you are really mixing up your training outside of what I am doing, rTSS probably isn't going to tell you the whole story anyway. The consistency of it (much like with power) seems to really work around the sub-threshold level. Of course, I have said before probably easy runs are over represented in rTSS. But again, assuming you roughly run them at the same % of intensity relative to your current fitness you input, it'll stay consistently over represented in time, so doesn't really matter if our intention is just to use it as a practical tool (which is all I care about). I'll happily leave the science to the much smarter guys than me. It's likely why the graph I shared on Strava fit so neatly, in terms of load versus performance, because my sessions are still for the most part comparible in intensity going right back (with a few changes to sneak in extra load) but also a decent invease in overall training time. In absolute simple terms , my daily average per session a year ago was 60 TSS per week and now it's 70. There's probably no real suprise that I'm fitter now, because I'm doing the same thing with a sprinkle of pushing the limits of sub threshold intensity, or just more or the same but longer. How you make up that increase is for you to work out, but that comes with experience if training like this.",

I’ll do reps where 46 or 47 per 200 is my goal pace and if I’m feeling good and not paying attention it’s easy to go out in 42-45(5k-10k pace) and the RPE feels sub threshold! I’ve come around to the idea that rpe is garbage and that objective measures of your output are really important. Now when I’m running reps I try to disassociate my rpe(which will slowly rise within each rep and through the workout) from how quickly I’m moving down the road. This has taught me to run a constant speed regardless of rpe and if I’m paying attention I can predict my 200m splits pretty well. If I space out and just keep the same rpe the pace drops. Rpe will rise over time, and at different rates, depending on where you are between LT1 and 2, but it will rise. if you keep rpe constant that’s a sign that the pace may be dropping (by a little if early in the workout and by more at the end).",

This is a great question though and I don’t think there’s a perfect answer except control what you can control. However, I don’t think I’m better off going by rpe in the summer. If I standardize the time of day I run and how to adjust paces, I think that would be good enough to get the work in consistently.",

Stuff felt hard, but actually the reality was it wasn't as hard as I thought. Chillruns idea of early as you can in the day, certainly worked for my easy runs where I could control HR to under 70% of max. I used that as my upper limit, as even in the morning that comes before 65% of MAS in sirpoc guide. For the workouts, investing in a lactate meter massively helped, as I could do a step test in good conditions then translate the paces outside. Again though, RPE is without doubt the worst marker here. The best solution is the workouts on the treadmill. I have managed to make this system work. I think ultimately, if you want to you could? But I accept , it requires a level of extra effort. xemptyzI don't think though many people would have much success with sirpoc's method, unless you have some way to keeo things consistent and measurable. Ultimately this is what creates the understanding of what you are doing, keeps you from going to hard but helps you understand how to quantify and build loads. There's no magic pill here, but I've learned that I can build all these things in, even despite my poor running environment and I set my HM PB after years of trying to break 1:15 just recently. Massively thankful to this thread and obviously sirpoc specifically. Best of running everyone.",

RPE had me going too hard. 7-8 is where my workouts would sit and there's something that sirpoc said that set off alarm bells for me. That his workouts were 5-6 normally. I had read the thread thinking there's no way I can do 3 workouts a week at what I was doing, mostly by feel. On hindsight, just running on feel was stupid. You often feel a million dollars until you don't. The paces are only a fraction slower than what I was doing, but the RPE and ability to workout 3 days a week is there. The structure is there for a reason to what sirpoc84 does, but took me a while to see it.",

    "message": "I'm digging into this approach a bit, sorry if this has been asked. -What is the purpose of the variation in rep schemes and paces, in the context of this program? I am looking at some recommendations (I don't remember if I saw them here, reddit, or the strava group) that say to alternate 12x3min, 9x4min, 6x6min, 4x9min reps between 15k, HM, and 30k pace, all with 1-minute jog, as a starting point. It seems to me like: -The pace variations there are so tight as to not make much of a difference, or even be possible to dial in that precisely (presuming road training). -Physiologically, what's the difference between 3/6/9 minute intervals, all with 1 minute jog rest? The goal of all of these workouts is to give an overall threshold stimulus, with rest for lactate to come down. It's not like they're really giving any different stimuli. I understand the point of a wide range of paces and rep schemes in a system like daniels or 5-pace, but this is a very simple and focused program without a wide range of paces and rep schemes, we're just splitting hairs on a tight range. If a runner were to run all of their workouts at 8x4min30sec, roughly between T and M pace, what would be the downside? Just getting bored?",

I'm not a scientist or even have a very scientific mind, but I think I can communicate very well with people and apply the things I do know, to success. I'll leave that for people to decide. I'll clear up the other two points. Coggan, whilst like marmite, has probably done more for the casual self coached athlete to understand their own training than anyone in the last 25 years. Whether anyone likes that or not, that's just a fact. Even though we are on a running site, just about everyone can learn something from his original book. Lexel will never be Coggan. As much as he probably wants to be. As for Hard2find, I mean come on, do I even need to defend him? His contribution to this thread speaks for itself. There's a reason lexel messages him asking for him to disentangle his data (note lexel, this is called a joke, or and example of banter). Lexel, for the record I think deep down is a good guy who wants to be liked or respected. But, you have to do something to earn it or just communicate in a better way.

I have a couple of HM and a 10k booked in this year but would like to get my 5k/Park Run down to the sub 18 level (pb 18:36) but idling around the 19:30 at present. I won't be able to copy your schedule on a 1:1 basis so have laid out my plan below. I can run 6 days a week, possibly 7. Given the importance of consistency of rTSS/load on a week to week basis I'll opt for 6 to avoid too much fluctuation on a weekly basis. I plan to a schedule my week as follows (time in parenthesis). E (40) - W (60) - E (40) - W (90) - E (40) - R - W (90) Workouts initially will be 8x3, 4x6 and 3x12. The last two sessions will be in W (90). If I run a 5k on the Saturday I'll likely make the first W (90) an E (90 or 60) as a mini taper. With the exception of the two W (90) sessions the other runs have to be juggled around lunchtime at work. If I'm in the office for optics I can really only commit 45 minutes at most for a run so the W (60) session would have to be cut short albeit it is only the non-workout element that is reduced. In such a scenario I would add the lost 15 minutes of easy running to one of the E (40) runs (when I'm not in the office). From a rTSS perspective the forecasted difference between E (40) + W (60) vs. E (55) + W (45) is only 2 points, so feels like it's within an acceptable range of tolerance. The only pitfall I see is the potential for the W (90) sessions to generate fatigue which over time may require dropping a session as a refresh or cutting it back to just an hour. At the end of the day it is just running and trying to stay as consistent as possible is the most important thing and replacing a W with E run every now and then won't see my “legs fall off” or too dramatic a drop in CTL.",

Personally I've found that if I do just a 2 week peaking block (eg sessions like 5-6*1mile at 10k pace, or even 2k reps) leading into race week then I get much better results than going into a race solely on sub T. It's almost like my heart needs a few extended efforts at properly high heart rates to be able to sustain it for an entire race, same for the legs and muscular endurance. When I go in solely after a long sub T block without either having done several parkruns or a couple of weeks of efforts I fade badly, almost like it's a shock to the system. Everybody is different so what works best for others may not work best for you. I'm convinced the sub-t method is a super efficient approach to improve your aerobic engine for most people, it just may be that you need to tweak the edges to get the best out of yourself on race day.",

But, for my last 5K, it felt almost impossible to run faster than 10K pace. I had zero kick. Looking back at my logs, it had been two months since I did a “X” session.

I'm sure he doesn't need me or anyone to tell him this, but obviously the big M is the perhaps the biggest challenge to dish up a good performance on the day.",

Kudos to him, he appears to have so far really nailed his colours to the mast. The principles are the same in terms of structure. Easy, Sub-T, and a long run.

    "message": "I think you have misunderstood what he means. Obviously, more volume required to run the marathon. But he's doing more volume now, than he did 2 years ago. He's always increased volume, almost unnoticed the build is so slow. But his training principle is absolutely the same, 75-25 ish split between time running easy and time running sub threshold. Scaled up from 5 hours a week to 7.5 and now likely 8+. If he hasn't increased volume and just had stayed the same a ability really and not improved any further. The whole point of this is you can probably increase load beyond what any other running plans put in place. Or certainly maximise or make the most of the time you have available. Many people have scaled this up or down , based on the available time you have. But the basics remain the same, you are running workouts in a sustainable way, 3 times a week. The change would be if the E-ST-E-ST-E-ST-LONG routine gets broken. Just to add my thoughts. Sirpoc I'm rooting for, but I don't think he will break 2:30 in his first attempt. I would advise him in all honesty to go down the 2Q approach for the next 8 weeks. His big base means if he started now, there's plenty of time to do the tail end of a more traditional marathon plan which will almost certainly have better results. For 5k-HM I would obviously not advise to change anything. It works remarkably well. But most people have blown their marathons when they have tried to train like this.",

I haven't ever seen him blow up any distance 5k-HM, though of course marathon is something else. 1:08-ish is well clear of what's needed to at least break 2:30. I say he does it easily Otherwise there's always the risk of first time marathon bonking that plagues everyone. But a 75 opener would be almost trivial, that's 17:46 5k pace. He could then ratchet it down towards 17:00s if he feels good. Probably leaves some time on the table running this way but a guaranteed sub 2:30.",

It's cool for fans of this thread there is two things in play at London, will Kiplimo run under 2 and will a 41 year old hobby jogger go sub 2:30, from nearly nowhere, even when this thread started the jump in levels is insane. I'm saying yes to both. I think you have laid out 2:30 is pretty easy paced like that. I think the under/over is probably lower than 2:30. One other reason I have confidence, is the course record for parkrun he just broke. It looks a really terrible course on paper, 3 dead turns, half of it on gravel and he ran 15:41. Not only that, I am as my name suggests a Strava snoot and 2-3 of the guys who time he beat just about on that course I had a look from Strava segment, have run sub 15 elsewhere and well under a sub 2:30 marathon, actually quite a bit under. I know that doesn't tell the whole story, but just thought I would add that. As yes he 'only' ran 15:41 but it's also basically reminiscent of a faster XC course. Anyway good luck to him and thanks for everything that's been brought to the thread, a marathon will be a nice way to round it off.

I took sirpoc advice and bought your book, I am a way in and I think a lot of what you talk about whilst power and cycling based, you would probably approve of how he's adapted, as best he can with the more basic tools runners have. It also made me realise how much we are crying out for power, on a usable and widespread scale.

Define the number of hours available for training, allocate max 25% of time to sub-treshold sessions. Establish your starting fitness and define workout paces based on that. The goal is introduce consistency and move away from the build and bust cycles (no more hiatus going forward). Get to a baseline structure that works for you and gradually increase it. Learn how to track your training load metrics if you want to be able to quantify your consistency (i.e. learn about CTL and plan to increase it gradually over time). You are not going to listen to my next point because you haven't read through the thread and you are not going to, but the key point of this methodology is that you don't need hill sprints or strides to get faster. I've read through the entire discussing over a couple of weeks and it put a smile on my face reading all the haters literally pooping on Sirpoc for how he is training, and yet, week after week, month after month he is still smashing PBs in the 5K up to the HM distance. This works because most of us are aerobically underdeveloped and speed is not the limiting factor until you hit very fast paces. Even the mile is 80% Aerobic, so working on the aerobic engine is what will give you the most time-efficient training load. ALso, easy day should be extremely easy, and there is no \"i felt good in this sub-T session so i converted it into VO2 session\". It is extremely boring, same thing, week in week out. Will you get faster results using a traditional Daniles plan? Possibly. But you are also way more likely to hit a brick-wall, injure yourself, lose motivation from feeling exhausted. So are you in for the long term? Stick with this plan until you plateu (and sploiler, still no sign of plateuing from Sirpoc, now approching the sub-15 5K in his forties)",

You could say he's managed to run a low 15 in spite of this, rather that because of this. Just looking at it from a running coach point of view. I've made a long career out of coaching and I'm reasonably insulted that suddenly people are latching onto the next training fad and forgetting that something like a Daniel's inspired method has worked time and time again for decades. If you think you can buy into Coggan's fantasy world of being able to quantify load, it's been proven time and time again there is no actual way to do this. Feel, day to day, session to session and providing feedback to a professional coach will ALWAYS be a better way of accounting for load than this. Runners aren't robot cyclists and won't ever be.

It most beneficial for 5k to half marathon because all it does is work the aerobic system at a speed sharp enough to stimulate a lactate response without exceeding threshold so to avoid excess fatigue. And you need to race frequently enough to keep touch with harder stuff even if its just a park run. You need all the other stuff to be exceptional but for the Hobby Jogger this is good enough.

Went from 38 to 33 in almost a year using sirpoc method in a 10k, which has been my focus. Training 4+ years almost exclusively with a Daniel's inspired coach after using the books basic plans myself for a cycle. Previously unstructed training for the two years previous. 33 years old. The big factor is the boom and bust Daniel's and his followers bring. It's insane when you think about it. In my opinion, that way of training is actually probably the best way if you are looking for just a 16 week block or build to one point in time. Almost the fit person, but casual runner than maybe has signed up to a half or 10k and it's all they care about. But outside of that, it's actually insanely sub optimal. For the seasoned runner, I'm 100% now behind what sirpoc has laid out will make you better over a long period. It's not even close. I'm glad and thankful I found the thread. Haven't posted before but the above really resonated with me and thought I must throw my hat into the ring.",

I have actually started a month ago with 10 x 30s/30s, then 8 x 45s/30s, slowly building my way. My plan is to replicate Jakob's sessions in terms of time, so end goal is: The plan is to run the short reps at 3:50-4:00, mid reps at 4:00-4:15 and long reps at 4:15-4:30. I'll go with 40 mins for easy days and 70 mins for long, for now, and adjust later on, if needed. I've said I started this week because I was not really controlling my easy runs, I was free-styling, even before thinking about Norwegian singles, which didn't leave enough energy for workouts and for my work/family and this had to change. I'm planning to use HR for this, avoiding going over 70% HRmax (138 HR) like the plague. This week, so far: I don't know if I can do quality sessions every 2 days yet, still adjusting mentally to the approach. I could do 1 Q session every 3 days initially, until I'm fixing the effort levels to go for 3 Qs/week. I'm probably running the reps too fast, but will learn & adapt the paces. My next session is 5 x 2:00/0:45 (ran 1:45/0:45 last week) scheduled for tomorrow. The plan is to build to 5 x 3:00/1:00 and then split the way, go for more reps at 3:00/1:00 or go for 5x longer reps up to 6:00/2:00. But let's not rush, will go for an easy run today.",

No wind almost at all he said, calm day which is why he did race last minute choice. I think he senses pace probably going to be lower by maybe 10 seconds at least on a looped 5k. I think more. If you look at Strava, 4 points in race where he had almost gone down to zero pace. 3+ turns + another moment you can see in run where he almost had to come to stop and accelerate again due to lap traffic.

It could be that sirpoc’s ability to run close to 5k pace in “easy” workouts is why he keeps improving (more than any other user of the method I’ve seen).

Some things that caught my attention. Sirpoc said: 76%-79% of FTP seems quite high for an \"easy\" run to me. I think most people do easy rides (cycling is my main sport) at lower intensity than that. Those sounds like decent workouts maybe on lighter side to me rather than easy days. Is it because those runs are limited to an hour/75 minutes while cycling easy rides are often multiple hours long? I feel those being not exactly jogging pace might be something important in the system. As to TSS discussion: I feel TSS might be even better for running than it is for cycling. In cycling there are people who do more hours than pros and are still mediocre. They ride all day long at snail pace almost every day and accumulate crazy hours (for some it's work as a bike guide, for others it's clueless training and a lot of free time). I am yet to see someone doing 2-3 hours of sub-threshold intervals every week stuck at mediocre level though. You can't do that in running as there are limits to how many kms per week the body can take. This means you can't cheat the system to the degree it's possible in cycling by accumulating tens of junk miles per week. In running you need to do actual intensity to increase your CTL and then it's a question of how to do it smartly. Question for Sirpoc84: you mentioned many times you took inspirations from cycling, mainly UK Time Trialing scene. Would you mind pointing to some resources about the kind of training you have done? Cycling is my main sport these days (I tried running and even finished one HM but I was never serious about it) and I find your approach very appealing. I would love to learn more about what shaped your mindset on it.",

    "message": "Race load is interesting. First, I find load more believable comparing like-for-like (e.g. did I build or decrease over months, given I've been running the same program the entire time), than for comparing completely different workouts. But let's ignore that for a second. I agree the race wrecks the legs more. But if you calculate the rTSS per hour, someone near Sirpoc's fitness might get ballpark ~116 for 5k pace and ~103-105 for 12-15k pace. Suppose he runs the 5k for 15:low and the reps for 31:mid. That comes out to ~85% more load for just the quality time on the 10x1k vs. the entire race. And if you have more easy running added on to the workout than the race your workout likely gives you more than double the rTSS of your 5k. Load is presented, at least in intervals.icu, as tracking both the stress on the body and the expected fitness gain. The race beats you up more than rTSS predicts; do you improve more from it as well? Is the inaccuracy in both aspects of rTSS, or does it point to a divergence between the stress and the fitness gain? If the divergence is real it suggests a major design consideration for our workouts should be how we can accumulate more rTSS without increasing recovery demand. That would probably lead us to pack on as much very easy mileage as we have time for, and to use reps to keep our lactate controlled in our quality sessions, and to separate our quality from our long run. Here's a longer cut of Sirpoc's very slow quote: > 3 easy runs a week. All under 70% of max HR which is usually about 65% of MAS for those who work in paces as well. This will keep you definitely under LT1. Long run, I tend to just keep the same and by the end I'll be almost at the upper limit of that 70% which is the goal. I think the recent studies which was excellent, on the training characteristics of long distance elite runners (2022) had easy characterised as under 70% Max HR. That seems slow. It is slow. Very slow.",

    "message": "The legs being wrecked more is true in my experience, but doesn't necessarily mean it's a better training load. It's taken me a while to get my head around that. This comes down to what sirpoc was describing at the start, the hard impact and feeling of the body the real speed workouts bring, but in the bigger picture not really leading to much improvement or possibly stopping you hitting the sessions that do make the difference- note his stagnation of a reasonably decent amount of time and the boom and bust cycle others have mentioned here, before he started training like he cycled. I'm coming well around to the idea that whilst the 5k might feel harder , the 10*3 mins workout is actually banking more overall benefit AND you remain fresher. I guess here for runners around 18-19 mins or under. I think if we are talking guys slower than that, it's a different story. Also, because I bug sirpoc all the time on Strava I followed up the quote above about how 'easy' he means. The answer I got was easy means easy and is easy, in COMPARISON to other running systems daily/easy/long run days , or what might get called steady runs etc. So it was much easier than what he had been prescribed by running plans before, I wholeheartedly agree with this. In this sense he seemed to mention 80/20 or Daniels that he said were remarkably hard in comparison and would quite quickly lead to problems if he followed the medium to high end of those \"easy\" day paces or efforts. At the end of the day there is obviously a huge amount in this and it clearly works for a vast number of people now, just look at the testimonials not just here but all over the internet. I would still ask why from a scientific point of view and also how remarkable it is the balance in general for most people for the original sirpoc lay out of 3 ST-3 EASY- 1 LONG seems to work. I don't know exactly but the Strava group, here, Reddit, Facebook group I have seen dedicated to it, you have to be looking at 70-80% of people sticking to it improve over a decent amount of time as a conservative estimate. On top of that, some of the jumps from even seasoned or long time runners are almost remarkable. The bit take I can see is we are moving away from the ridiculous boom and bust cycles and allowing people to balance on the cautious side of where freshness lives which then seems to be allowing people to increase load beyond any other plan has ever allowed them before, whilst maintaining the 3 workouts which seeminglly whilst easier, aggregate in more than the equivalent of a 2Q week. I will add I am incredibly fast twitch, I saw that debate - but I also have absolutely smashed through walls and boundaries in my second life as a runner. I've run 16:33 which is almost my best from college and I'm 37 with a family of 3 to look after and all the stresses that brings. I've totally ditched absolutely everything but the 3 sub Threshold sessions a week and the easy. I was pretty happy with my turkey trot 18:21 in my 30s but absolutely delighted with my 16:33 a year and a bit on. Shout-out again though to sirpoc himself, always happy to help and answer even though I'm sure he's fed up on Strava and pushed me onto the right path when I had some questions. TL;DR of this bit, whilst I maybe took me a few extra weeks to adapt than others have suggest. This is absolutely for older fast twitch hobby joggers like me as well. Oh and good luck to sirpoc in the London Marathon . I'm also feeling good that at the ripe age of 41 he will break 2:30 at his first attempt. As long as he doesn't do anything stupid , 2:30 is almost a worst case scenario. I also don't know how many non-former elites break 15 in their 40s, but I think he will soon join that very small fraction of a % of runners. Really enjoy the thread, thanks to all the other top posters as well. From shirtboy, unbelief keeping everyone on their toes, Coggan when he's in good spirits and not wasting time with lexel, big shout-out to Hard2find as well, some amazing resources. I'm sure others should be included, but they are the people I think of.",

I’ve had a lot of success with just going off heart rate using a strap. Some guys don’t recommend it, but I couldn’t find a better way in my situation. I’ll give you an example. My max heart rate is only 171 and my LTHR is 154 (according to Garmin). I usually top out around 146 on my first rep, 148 on the second and 150-152 on the last one. It’s definitely not a walk in the park but it also doesn’t bury me and it keeps me from being stupid and running too hard. Pushing CTL up and gaining fitness with this method is tough work… but not VO2 max laying on the ground afterwards tough.",

    "message": "For those thinking about the mile. Here's just my experience. I had always wanted to break 5:30. I was always on the cusp of it and then it just never worked out. Followed quite a few classic mile programs , all resulted in around that. Decided to focus on other things. Found this thread around 14 months ago now, to train mostly for 5k, 10k. Before this, was training in the classic cycles, 5-6 hours a week for probably a good decade. Limited success, knew my place in the hierarchy of hobby joggers. You get the drift! Didn't really think about the mile. Anyway, pretty much went down the 1:1 route as seems to be the next success of copying the sirpoc method. I call it that, as there are other ways to dial this up but I think mostly 1:1 is the best option rather than the more catchy NSM which is broader. So no hills, no strides, no 200m track repeats, just get into the meat of the routine and tick off the 3 sessions a week and otherwise just easy running. Summary, low 17 5k, mid 35 for a 10 and ran a low 1:18 HM. All absolutely blew apart my PBs. Scroll ahead to January this year, jumped in a local mile with no other thought than being annoyed it would break up my winning weekly schedule, ran 4:57. OK maybe you could make an argument for dialling in something short like the mile to really tease out a few more seconds? By what's the point. It's neglible probably compared to the absolutely huge jump I've made due to the nature of the aerobic gains across the board. And hey, it's a whole lot of fun suddenly beating people comfortably who have beaten you in all distances in the past! Also note, couldn't imagine running any other training method, where for the most part you can go day in, day out and no breaks between the seasons of cycles.",

I recommend to run by time instead of distance. Become a slave of your watch (pace or power). Here are the three workouts: 4min Reps @ 10k pace (7 reps and one 1min rest in between): 7:44min/mile or 4:48min/km 6min reps (5 reps and 60-90sec rest): 7:50min/mile or 4:52min/km 8min reps (4 reps and 90sec rest): 7:56min/mile or 4:56min/km Give it a go and adjust if it feels too hard or too easy, but this should be roughly right for your current fitness. do the same every week. Run the easy day super easy (no faster than 10:12min/mile or 6:20min/km).

Did the little league coach do everything he could to get you on base so could steal your way to 3rd? Then you're probably fast twitch. Were you outrunning kids in the 4th quarter in 6th grade basketball when everyone else was gassed? You're probably a combo or ST? What events did your junior high & high school coach put you in for track? I remember in field day way back in 3rd grade where we participated in everything from throws, to long jump to sprints, 1 lap around the field race, & finally a 2 lap race. Even then I was middle distance doing best in the 1 lap race. I was always OK in sprints & distance but not great. Went to state in the 800. Same thing today distance wise, & I'm in my mid 40s. I think this training leads to more advantages for FT or a combo (yes I know everyone is a combo). ST runners will benefit too obviously & they could likely afford to run closer to threshold for workouts. If FT are careful & keep it at Sub T (or a little slower) & keep their easy runs truly easy, I could see them really flourishing with this training. As my fitness has improved as a FT runner I've decreased recovery time from 60 sec to 45 sec instead of increasing pace. I do that for a couple weeks then cautiously go back to 60 sec recoveries with increased paces for the Sub T workouts. Similar to the method Hadd training used for FT runners. (I also make myself keep jogging at a decent pace between reps to make sure I'm not tempted to run the sub T reps too hard & dip into anaerobic.)",

I'm not saying people won't find it useful, but it's not consistent enough across the board for me to be invested in it. As for the longer workouts, they have been carefully designed so like the other workouts I am sitting a decent amount under LTHR for the majority and maybe finishing up around (but just under) LTHR. First big session of these I dug the lactate meter back out, to give myself an idea of where I am at on these and I am pretty happy with the plan I have in place. The pace or % of a race pace is largely irrelevant, it's the actual state I'm interested in. I'll probably never do enough of these for me to be confident of giving out a general guide for these extra long reps. But, it's a tad faster marathon pace. I also, suspect, because of my aerobic engine, it's probably tricky for people to replicate these sessions themselves like for like. I can definitely complete this at a paces faster to race paces, than I could even a year ago. I certainly wouldn't recommend or jump in on these.",

But the Garmin wrist power is a mess and in the wind and the stryd doesn't make any sense. I can run in the wind and it'll give me 20-30w more for say a 10 min block because of how it overestimates power into the wind on the track (depite basically a total even effort). Nobody wants power to work probably more than me, but it's just too much of a headache for me to care about at this point. It doesn't measure force. Until it does, it's just an algorithm really that is guesstimating a lot of things. If you run on a treadmill or in completely controlled conditions, it might work way better. I've never run on a treadmill in my life, so can't comment. I think a big issue is how windy it is where I am right on the sea and flat open spaces. The stryd really is comical with some of the stuff it comes up with. In the early days I played around a lot with going right up to LT2 (if it exists, there's one to apart some debate lol) and beyond, testing on the meter to see what I could get away with. I spent a good number of weeks and months playing around with all combos before I settled on the amount of lactate I could generate and the pace proxys in place to replicate that (roughly) - and then feel OK to go again in 48 hours. None of this was done on a whim and a prayer, it was carefully planned out. But the big note, I only intended this for myself. I didn't intend, at any point to it blow up like this. Having said that, whilst some people have had to tweak things or start off with the paces slower, it's actually held up very well as a general one size fits all approach (obviously it's impossible to have a blanket approach for everyone). There's obviously a million ways to train. There might be a better one on 7 days a week and only an hour or so to dedicate to training in a day. But if there is, i'm yet to have tried it. I'm absolutely not the guardian of this system, despite what the internet seems to think. If there is another or better way to train and someone could show me that, I'll jump all over for it. After all I basically just stole this idea from my own training in another life as a cyclist, of which I just stole from others. All I've done really is lay it out or I guess communicate what I've done in a way people can interpret or understand.

    "message": "You do want to watch quality : easy volume, as that gives you a proxy for the level of strain that your body can safely handle. I do it based on time at pace, not volume, and not including the rests even if they’re jogged. I‘m a bit confused by your focus on very short intervals. Because they’re so short, your margin of error for pacing correctly becomes razor thin… and your HR data suggests to me you’re erring here. Your avg HR on your rests should be noticeably lower than your ON intervals! Instead it’s effectively the same or even higher. For comparison, when I do 1km repeats with 60 sec jogging rest, I’ll still see an avg >=10bpm lower, and my HR will come down to ~70% MHR before the next interval starts. You might be eliciting a sub-threshold state on these workouts, but the design makes me think more of tightly controlled fartlek and I suspect your lactate levels are bouncing and rising throughout. It’s sustainable at the moment because you’re not doing very much quality volume — just under 10% of total weekly volume (36min of 375min). That’s just not very much stimulus. I‘m not suggesting jumping into 20-25% of your total volume right away, but I think you will really benefit more from longer intervals and larger workout volume. Try 6 x 3min (60sec rest) and 3 x 6min (90sec rest) to start. That’ll give you 18min of quality in each session, which is still on the low end for the time volume you’re doing per week. You can add more in coming weeks to get up to 20%, then assess from there. It‘s not that shorter intervals can‘t have their place in a system like this, but maintaining a pace for longer periods requires training mechanical efficiency too, and with 60sec/30sec you’re changing gears an awful lot. That’s why most everyone here is doing 3-4min as their shortest interval.",

    "message": "Thank you for your perspective and tips! It seems that there is plenty of room to add more intensity, but as you said, just not right away. Even though it's not much now, it's more than I've done this winter and I'm not feeling that I'm doing too little, just the right amount so far. As for the short reps, it's part of the build-up, but I might adjust it. I've said previously that I want to mimic Jakob's sessions (25 x 400 off 30s, 10 x 1K off 1 min and 5 x 6 min/2 min) by making them time-based, so I imagined Jakob runs the 400s at around 60 and Ks around 3:00. I've started with very little(10 x 30s/30s) and slowly extending the number and/or the length of the reps to adjust both to the increasing threshold volume and to the mindset, as I've been previously trained with polarized training. The plan is to get to 5 x 3:00/1:00 and then go in 2 directions, 1/ towards 10 x 3:00/1:00 and 2/ towards 5 x 6:00/2:00. I will have to decide at some point if I want to keep the 60s intervals or go for longer, but for now I'm trying to shoot for 25 reps to have some decent volume before moving up. As for breaks, the HR raises during the interval and I'm starting the rest with the peak HR of the previous rep and jogging it doesn't lower HR too much. Maybe when the reps get longer I will have more stable HR during the reps and more chances to drop it during the breaks. During the last 5 x 2:00/0:45 session I had no cardiac drift from rep to rep, so I don't know if I have to dial back on effort, but will error on cautious side whenever I feel like it.",

    "message": "Hi Sirpoc, I can think of 3 ways that elicit similar input and output: 1. What you are already proposing: Sub-T with intervals ranging from 3-10mins adding up to around 30 mins of work in total. 2. Marathon pace continuous runs of around 45mins, perhaps up to 1h (the pace would likely be below MP, more around high-end aerobic if you are closer to elite) 3. Shorter Sub-T intervals: Sub-T with intervals of 30 secs to 90 seconds depending on level of runner, but roughly 200m and 400m intervals ranging from mile pace up to 8k pace. Also, possible to include 800m interval at 15k pace. This is what many call the easy interval method developed by Verheul and adapted by Klaas Lok. Think of it this way on a spectrum of sub-T stimulus: continuous 3hr pace run to long intervals (sirpoc method) to short intervals (verheul method) all performed at a pace that ideally stays just under LT2. I have tried all of them all and my preference over the years has shifted more from continuous MP runs (which I did almost daily that is difficult to believe now, but I had no life stress at that point, so was able to absorb it) to short intervals. The way I think about long sub-T vs. short sub-T intervals is there are trade offs: Long sub-T intervals (say 6x1k, 3x2k, 2x3k for a slower runner) has the advantage of accumulating a lot of running right below threshold, but it does not involve faster paces, so doesn't engage full range of muscle fiber activation, neuro-muscular adaptation, etc. (for example HM-30k pace all involve high activation of slow twitch, but little fast twitch, etc.) Short sub-T intervals (20x200m, 15x400m) has the advantage of practicing faster paces with fast twitch activation, running economy, etc. as above, but it does not accumulate as much running right below threshold due to HR rising and declining during shorter intervals. This results in a lower average HR than long sub-T intervals. Think of it this way if LT2 occurs at HR 170, a 2k run will have the majority of it in 165-170, whereas a 400m interval will have less than half of it in that HR range. Even if the total distance covered is the same shorter intervals result in lower total load than longer intervals. So I think those are the main tradeoffs between the two. Long sub-T intervals are basically a happy medium between continuous and longer MP runs and shorter sub-T intervals. Just my 2 cents.",

When I go for a run, I put an alcohol wipe, a cotton pad, a strip, and two lances in the lactate pro 2 container. Before my run, I set the container down in the area I'm going to test (note there are temp requirements for the strips, so if you're doing it in freezing temperatures, I leave it in my car). I insert the strip loosely in the lactate pro 2 -- not all the way pushed in, but close. That way you don't have to fish for it when you're done running. After running, I tear open the alcohol wipe, rub over two fingers (usually middle and ring of left hand) and also over index and thumb of my right hand to avoid contamination. Then I tear open the pad and dry the alcohol. Prick with the lancet on one of the two wiped fingers, press out a drop, wipe off with the pad, press out a drop again. You want the drop to be large, because you want to dip the top of the lactate pro strip into the top of the drop pressing down into your finger. This also means its easiest if you can rest the lactate pro and strip somewhere, and move your finger up into it, rather than holding the lactate pro and moving down onto your finger -- more stable and precise that way. When you see the blood start moving into the strip, hold for 2 seconds. Moving quickly away will likely lead to errors. Then make sure you throw away all the med waste, might be worth bringing a disposal bag to do so.",

Forget doubling, you are aiming for the higher end of sub threshold. Whatever that number is in terms of lactate, means absolutely nothing unless you have done testing yourself. But, it's been clearly stated it's pushing towards the boundary of LT2. It's more aggressive than doubles. I wouldn't worry too much about what KI has done lately, he has lost his way a bit. He's lactate testing a bit blind in my opinion and has lost any real purpose. Experimenting perhaps, pushing too hard in patches, just basically not getting any consistency whatsoever, which is what this plan is all about. Whereas I think this thread if you follow the training load quantification aspect, you will probably understand where you want to get to, rather than just testing lactate - especially for the athlete who is old and also has limited time on their hands. Whether the trolls like it or not, sirpoc himself is the absolute standard bearer of this method. I would urge anyone to look at what he's doing. It's remarkable how he continues to work out how to progress. Key note here is the lactate testing is pretty much only a tiny part of the plan, which makes it a ton more practical and why so many people have had success copying him.",

    "message": "Of course it doesn't push as close to LT if you are cycling. But you might do 3x20 at least 3 times a week. You can't sustain that kind of volume or impact from running. So with running singles, you generate as much load as you can, within the hand you are dealt , with having in mind, you train again in 48 hours + an easy run in-between. The whole theory of this, is you generate as much accumulated load as you can that is sustainable, week to week, month to month. As we have seen with Sirpoc84 marathon build, you might have to come and think outside of that a bit. Time will tell, I guess as to it this works or not. But who is to doubt the man, at this point? I think I would agree for the most most part, if you care about 5K- HM this is almost certainly the best way or very close to, for someone with limited time to train. There's a reason why this thread is still going, it's because more and more people are still finding it and having remarkable success.",

    "message": "cyclist do this quite differently in the terms that they periodize and continually increase the SS duration. The norwegian model is much more of a focus on continuity. This of course has been mentioned several times in this thread. In running there's always a limit to how much you can do, but in cycling you can do a lot and then periodize blocks with rest. My point is that whether you run 85 or 95% of LT doesn't have a big difference on your cardiovascular system. Mechanical, yes, but, your gains will most likely be the same whether you run and measure 2.5 or 3.0 during for example 5x6 minutes. My whole point with this was that if you have not taken the LT test yet, and want a simple way to start asap, you can run at the lower point of the range. This is also what Bakken has said. Of course, any runners should also use other metrics like HR or RPE together with the lactate. Being a cyclist you also learn in a great way how to feel sweet spot compared to FTP(threshold). Sirpoc used this to his advantage.",

    "message": "I had considered dabbling in cycling and I asked sirpoc himself what his weeks were like. Whilst there was some overload and sometimes doubling if time allowed, for the most part he basically did what you described. Down weeks are a thing of the past in cycling, gone are the days where you might have half the winter off. They are absolutely stacking load upon load all year round now, as you suggest. As much as I enjoy the chat in this thread and the science, I can't help but think we are trying to over complicate things. For a hobby guy in either sport, sirpoc has got to the top fraction of a %. Probably even more so actually in running, if you consider he's 41 and probably going to run sub 15 soon. I guess maybe a dozen guys in the whole of the UK might do that this year in that age group? I would probably bet, he trains the least amount of hours to get there. Maybe I'm wrong, but I can't imagine it's much more than that number of runners. The main takeaway though is how disciplined this mo for is and consistent. Being able to do the same thing, week in, week out stick to the basics and fundamentals of what you are doing and look at the results? Of course if you wanted to dial in performance more he could add some specificity. But does it matter? I'd rather be an all round distance hobby jogger hero rather than dialing in just to get another 5 seconds in a 5k. You have to remember what nobody is saying here: this isn't the greatest training method in the history of endurance sports. But, for a large percentage of people it's likely the smartest and safest way to get to the best of your ability, for the majority who find themselves time crunched. It's probably not even up for debate, at this point. I've said before, put me firmly from skeptical, into unsure, into full bought in. It's totally changed how I think about the sport and endurance in general and what actually makes you good.",

Other training approaches consider a few aspects: cardiovascular, physiological, psychological, and even gastrointestinal. My take on the sir_poc approach/NSA is that it clearly tries to optimise cardiovascular fitness given available time around 7 hours, but I'm interested in whether by ignoring the other facets it is suggesting they matter far less than thought, or are just not mentioned so far. Being clearer for each: Physiogical: I've not seen any mention of drills to include strides, skips, plyos or anything else which stands to improve running economy or strengthen and prepare joints and tendons for increased load (possibly including general strength too). Do we consider them irrelevant in this approach, or are we still recommending them in parallel? Psychological: many runners refer to the psychological benefits from knowing how a certain pace feels or being more confident they can hold it or something around it for a portion of what they would in a race. Do we accept that trusting the approach *is* the psychological advantage here? Gastrointestinal: perhaps more relevant for the marathon, how do you train your gut for intense work whilst absorbing carbs and liquids without doing long runs to simulate?",

Physiological: Generally no harm in doing a few strides after easy runs a 1-2x a week. Same with strength if you have some underlying weaknesses worth addressing. If you feel you benefit from it then by all means do some, I guess what this approach shows is that doing loads of it is probably not required. Psychological: probably not necessary strictly speaking, but there are plenty of examples of people doing 1-2 indicator/specific workouts (even Almgren pre-Valencia did a session which seemed to be a bit more of a tester/confidence booster). Overall I think trusting the process is a pretty good approach to building enough confidence, but we’re all different. Again, wouldn’t overdo it on this stuff though. Gastrointestinal: it’s clear that for the Marathon something in this approach needs to change, if at the very least scaling the Long Run quite significantly to 2hr+ and perhaps including some chunks at pace for a couple of them in the final 5-6 weeks pre-race. Good chance - and makes sense - to fuel these.",

Doesn't help that I have recently been doing a lot of these intervals on the treadmill, aerobically I felt great but the legs didn't respond well to pounding the pavement even though my marathon PB was only 16 weeks ago with more traditional training. Spoc has gotten his long run to 20 miles, though, and his overall mileage is way better than mine, so it's less about the method and more about respecting the distance, hopefully he can convert his time better than I did. EDIT: Also, the marathon is quite unique in terms of the mental grind, I think, so it's worth thinking about whether this method, or any other training system is aimed at just improving the underlying physiology, or whether grit and toughness can be trained as well and that's why some people hate on this method too much as it feels too easy. Spoc is coming from years of performing at a high level in cycling time trials so I'm sure he was used to the suffering already, but if you've never run some of these distances before, the mental reset after each rep is so nice in training but could backfire on race day. Basically, my main limiting factor was muscle, but I also wasn't willing to suffer enough to push through that pain, not sure if a Pfitz style 18 miles w/ 14 miles @ MP would have helped with that.",

    "message": "Thanks for bringing this back up! Good reminder of old wisdom – sirpoc is a fantastic bloke and exemplar of this training's success, but would be the first to say this this is not shiny or new. One thing that I often think about (and have found good success with) over the years is something that sirpoc continues to emphasize in his posts: he would likely train differently if he was much LESS or much MORE time constrained. I've seen huge improvements with this adapted sub-T in singles approach (7-8 hours per week running) and follow it more closely than, for example, Tinman's CV-focused approach, but there is value to adapting my training depending on my weekly time constraints which do vary quite a bit when I travel for work. However, when I get down to weeks of <3 hours running per week (during work travel), 20-25% weekly volume in sub-T is simply not that much and my fitness declines sort of quickly after two weeks reduced volume. But, when I introduce slightly more intensity at these lower volumes (without resorting to VO2 reps), such as 8x3 min at CV pace or the 25x1 min sub-T workout, I seem to bounce back to full volume and intensity more quickly after a couple weeks of reduced volume. This is just anecdotal though and works for me as a mid-twitch (neither fast-twitch, nor slow-twitch) guy.",

    "message": "This is what people really need to realize. I've been doing the sub-T singles 2-3 days a week for a year now and it's been great (I've PR'ed in the 5km and the half marathon last fall). 10,000m of reps can be in the moment, but always controlled and i never feel drained. I never have to commit a ton of time to a weekend (or heaven forbid mid-week) long run. I think my longest runs are around 85 minutes. I never wake up feeling drained from the sessions the day before. The lack of periodized training is (to me) a feature, not a bug - because I never get that burnt out by training and never need to take weeks off after peaking for an \"A\" race. But it's not the only way to train. We discussed Tinman a few pages back; he famously promoted the Critical Velocity system that worked great for so many high school runners; many of which are running well less than the ~7 hours a week that's being committed to this system. Hell, many high schoolers are probably only putting in 3.5 - 4 hours a week across Monday - Friday school days. If that's all a coach can get from them, then they need something more intense to optimize their training load - something like Critical Velocity is great for that. Sub-elites and Elites (or just hobbyists with way more time) putting in 80+ miles a week can structure things differently, because they have the bandwidth to include workouts like longer LRs, MLRs, literal double thresholds, etc. It's yet again an entirely different set of constraints (to borrow a word or concept from Magness). Again, big fan of this system and still keeping at it myself after a year. I do think some people have been a bit too dogmatic about it though.",

I have a lactate meter and in order for me to keep my lactate <4 (I personally aim for somewhere between 3.0-3.5) I have to run slower by a significant amount (15-20 seconds/mile) to stay under threshold. It could be because I am not as aerobically as fit as sirpoc and others, I'm not quite sure. Before you ask, I plugged in a 5k time trial result done untapered in non-carbon fiber shoes to generate my suggested 4min, 8min, 12min workout pace. What I've found is that if the intervals even feel slightly hard then my lactate reading at the end is usually >4. Additionally, I would recommend against trying to correlate HR with lactate levels (obviously if your HR is 200 your lactate is going to be high and vice versa) but I've done workouts where my HR has stayed relatively low and my lactate reading was 6.X Overall, I think purchasing the lactate meter has been helpful for my situation or else I would be frying myself trying to hit the suggested interval paces when they seem to not quite fit the bill for me",

I knew quite quickly this increase in load would be doable, but I wasn't going to like it. Would I be able to sustain this for the next 2 years, like I have done? Probably not. Who knows, I may well make a mess of the marathon and then be forced to keep going. But my training load has increased to it's highest point ever, so that's something. I've always suspected a basic marathon training plan is actually probably the best \"traditional\" way to train, in the sense you see a lot of guys collect PBs on the way to a marathon, simply because they are doing more. I'm at the point now where anymore time spent training, would be smarter to spread into doubles, at least some of the week. That won't be me though, I'll probably just carry on until I fall apart finally and then disappear back into being a non runner 😅 Once you are past that 8.5-9 hour range doubles are best and then in my opinion nobody needs me, my ideas or my opinion on any of that. Bakken, Jakob and his crew etc . (And others) have pretty much solved probably the best way for guys to train, who have pro level hours available. The one thing I still stand by, all this time on - is that this is still \"probably\" the best way I could have possibly trained, given time constraints of 5+ hours a week (originally) up to around 8.5 hours. The real secret is the structure and recovery aspects compared to other systems though, is I have managed to make it up to 8+ hours regular a week and build such a big base. It broke the boom and bust cycle and is balanced enough, whilst tetering on the edge that you can just keep stacking those training bricks.",

I've been in the Strava group since its formative days (back when it was 200 or so people strong) and haven't really seen this discussed which is why I brought it up. Again, I think highly of this method, but the exact paces may need to be modified for some people because it is very easy to go over threshold without realizing it. The best correlate I've found is that if the workout does not feel completely doable and/or slightly hard then the lactate is probably over threshold. I've long forgone the suggested paces, I just hit the paces that I know generate the lactate I am looking for, so not sure what exactly is crazy about this.",

So workouts are still pretty much where they should be always, sub threshold. I haven't raced anything quick really since very early Jan, so no racing to provide much of a guide, other than two slow (ish) parkrun courses. Yet the beauty of training like this, in time the workouts will pretty much tell you what race shape you are in, just through experience and repetition . It's actually the beauty of training like this - as you can pretty much guage how you will perform, which in turn makes pacing easier, which in turn means you will get close to maximum possible performance. I felt confident I would PB today, thinking I could definitely go sub 31 and set off at that as goal pace, although this might have surprised me even a bit today.

I haven't had issues with shorter reps on 4th week, HR dropped a bit at the same pace with more reps, confirming it was an environment factor. As I've reached a milestone in previous week, 5 x 3:00/1:00, the training is going in 2 directions now, finally, one towards 5 x 6:00/2:00 @ 4:20-4:30/km and another one towards 10 x 3:00/1:00 @ 4:10-4:20/km. After running 5 x 3:15/1:15, I've got the impression that the rest was too much, or maybe because the pace was a bit slower. The HR dropped a lot during the rest periods. I'll run longer reps soon and if rest still feels too long, I'll probably keep it Overall impressions after 1 month: - I was running too fast on easy days previously - I like the consistency of the program, even though others consider it repetitive/boring - After an initial drop, adjusting to new paces (especially on easy days, where I was running too quick), I'm sloooowly getting back to original paces, but at lower HR levels - My Garmin doesn't like me right now, my LTHR was 4:27 @ 174 HR, now it shows 4:33 @ 172 HR. I'm wondering why LTHR is dropping, considering my max is 197, I would expect it to be around 177-179 HR.",

    "message": "Thanks to the person who organised all of the valuable info in this thread onto the website below: I'd browsed the thread a few times, but always gave up after a few pages because the useful stuff just got crowded out by all the noise. I guess I'm pretty late to this, but I've been doing Double Threshold regularly since July last year and had a huge breakthrough after just 9 weeks of doing it. I'm now 35 years old and I've been running consistently for 11 years (after stopping for 5 years from the ages of 19-24). I stagnated at around mid-17s for 5k (even regressed back to 18 mins) at the age of 32, until I started using cross training as a way to do a modified version of Double threshold. I achieved good results with this at first, going from mid-17 down to 16:28 for 5k, and from 36:50 down to 34:47 for 10k. Half Marathon also came down from 1:27-high to 1:18. But then I seemed to plateau again, which prompted me to finally get the nerve to do actual Double Threshold (both as runs). I read everything I could by Marius Bakken, listened to every podcast of elites who used the system and took on any piece of advice by coaches who programmed Double T, and then devised my own system using HR and the data I'd collected from my previous HMs, Marathons and all the threshold running I'd done up to that point. I reckoned that the top end of my LT1 HR was 154 (based on the steady state I was in during the first half of Marathons) and my LT2 was 163 (based on the same but during HMs). And then I essentially just copied the Ingebrigtsen workouts but with the volume scaled down (started at 4 x 6 mins for the morning and 12 x 400m for the evening), the rest slightly adjusted (e.g 400s take Jakob 62-64 seconds, but they were taking me 80-84 seconds, so I did 40 seconds rest rather than 30 to line up with a 2:1 work to rest ratio) and used the HR figure as a barrier to stay below (rather than lactate). I also wasn't doing their \"X-Factor\" workout; just 2 double threshold workouts a week and every few weeks I'd do a cross country race (7-9k) in place of one of the Double T days. I saw immediate improvements once again, taking my 10k from 34:47 down to 33:19 after just 12 double threshold days (in 9 weeks) and my 3k from 9:28 down to 9:16. I then got sick and picked up a nagging calf problem from that 3k race, and so I lost a bit of form. I was also trying to \"peak\" during track season, so I was trying to include a VO2 Max session each week rather than trying to accumulate more and more threshold running, which in hindsight, seems like a mistake. Anyway, I scrounged out some more improvement in the 5k, going from 16:28 down to 16:08 in January, but wasn't satisfied at missing sub-16. I've since been running more Double Threshold, but have still felt the need for the odd VO2 Max workout (every few weeks). However, after reading Sirpoc's posts and other testimonials, I'm sold on the idea of ditching VO2 Max completely, and trying the Norwegian Singles Approach rather than Double Threshold as I've been doing. The reason being, it appears that I could achieve more time at an intensity closer to LT2 using this method. For instance, I'm usually getting around 15.5k of LT1 running and only 14ks of LT2 work in each week. I tend to do my LT1 workouts at around 3:50-4:00/km, whereas the slowest time I'm prescribed on the Norwegian Singles Calculator is for 3 x 3k at 3:34-3:44/km. It seems like I'd be getting in 24ks (at first, but with the prospect of building to more) of a higher quality, rather than 29.5ks of a mixture of LT1 and LT2. The way I do LT2 basically lines up with what you guys are defining as Sub-T also e.g a typical evening workout might be 7 x 1k at 3:30/km off 60\" recovery. Anyway, a very long post, but I'm wondering what others would recommend?",

    "message": "At 40 miles per week depending on your speed it's probably fitness enough to do 3 workouts right away but to be safe it's best to just do one the first week back to training after rest, then two the next week then three the third week. If you've already been jogging for some time after your season ended (not just fully resting) then you can jump straight into 2 or 3 workouts. Workout volume is best scaled to be about 10% of your total weekly mileage. So 40 miles per week would mean 4 miles of intervals. You would have to calculate that on your own, can't give any example workouts at all, since you didn't provide us with any paces. But anything like 8x3 minute if that works to around 4 miles for you, or 4x6 minute, or etc. If you are fast enough you can run intervals on the track like 400m, 1k, 1600m, 2k, 3k, 3200m, but then you'd have to be doing close to 1min for 400s, 3min for ks, 6min for mile, 7min for 2k, and 11-12min for 3k for the times to work.",

    "message": "Hopefully this post doesn't embarrass \"sirpoc\" too much. I say that, mainly because he's a really down to earth and humble guy. My story is I am mid 30s. An OK runner and have been running track and the road for around 8 years. I have been obsessed with a long term goal for a long time, of breaking 18! Hey, I know some of you guys will be like breaking 18 is chump change! But for me it seemed like a hurdle I could not overcome. Anyway, the meat of the story is I get talking to this guy at my local track. I saw him often and he seemed to not really be killing himself during this track time and yet me and my buddies are out on the floor, spread across the track after 6*1k. 7*800. You get the idea. Then this guy is still going but clearly not all out. Also, on my \"easy\" runs I'm overtaking him if I see him out on his easy days. It didn't add up. I saw him at a race and asked him what this secret was as he was crushing me and others I knew all last summer and leading into this year. He was quite helpful when we had ended up leaving around the same time after one session and I asked a few questions. He said about how he just does 3 sub threshold runs a week and that was it plus easy. I was skeptical but he insisted that was it. I googled it and found quite a lot of information but mostly just used a lot of what he told me. He offered to give me some basic plans and we exchanged details. The guy kindly send me weekly plans off his own back, he had no need to. All he said is I will owe him a beer one day and that I would easily break 18 and was happy to help. Anyway, let's get to the good part! Firstly, after around 9 months of this I broke 18 finally! And 17 ! I ran 16:54 this weekend just gone. For a while I kept the coach I was paying at the track but he told me this plan was crazy and I was going to fail. So we parted ways. My instincts told me this guy who offered to help would get me there. No idea why. Now, the funny thing? The guy turned out to be sirpoc! I literally never put 2 and 2 together until last week and the 10k he ran. He never once told me he was basically THE guy, effectively the person who laid out the whole NSM you will find here, Strava, reddit. Or the sirpoc method. Or whatever this is. I just find that really sums the guy up. Anyway, I would just like to thank him again and who knows, maybe this will help one other person have the confidence to sticking to the plan. The not running near race pace was the thing that spooked me the most. Especially as with my group of running friends I was the only one who really went with this. My main takeaway is I feel fresher to put the work in. The sessions and easy paces my coach had me doing were really holding me back I think. So tired. 75-80% HR on \"easy\" runs was nuts looking back and that coupled with how hard workouts were, always felt drained and once a month he was having me have a down week to recover. Maybe more so after a key race. This is that boom and bust cycle we keep seeing people talk about I guess. Now I truly feel like I can run everyday and things are under control and I can build load. My race at the weekend was strange. I knew I was going very well as my paces obviously were much higher in training. But I was turly taken back at how easy 3:28/km felt for the first K. As I hadn't ran anything near that, so I was nervous. But I finished strong with a 3:21 KM and that was it. My adult lifetime goal blitzed through. I hadn't run a 5k in 9 months, but I did run a low ish 35 10k the week before in the race sirpoc was i, so I knew this was possible if I held it together and paced it well. So wasn't a total shock, but to break 17 is almost a lifetime running achievement ticked off! Anyway, sirpoc , next time you are at the track, there will be a full crate of beer waiting with your name on it! Good luck in London pal!",

If you look to apply it to a marathon, consider (a) directly following what was conveyed by that guy on Reddit who had success (do the standard sirpoc plan for around 9 months very consistently, then begin the kind of modifications they made for the marathon), or (b) doing something different ONLY if you’re able to find info on a host of others who had similar success have done something a little different. Remember one of the more frequently stated points of caution: The people who seem to have little success with this method are the ones who don’t follow it super-carefully (whether by charting load in the spreadsheet, lactate testing, or whatever).

Since then my easy paces have come down to 8:40, and subT days have nearly doubled in mileage and pace has dropped to 7:40 for total run with warm up, subT, and cool down. Have been on very low mileage, weeks consisting of 20-34 miles per week, looking to ramp it up for a fall marathon. I typically do 3 subT efforts per week, sometimes including the 3rd in the long run, which isn't very long. Some weeks I only do 2 subT workouts. Instead of racing I have done some hard segments, which are basically races, 1 mile segments at 20 seconds faster than 5k pace. Next 5k here in April, then that will be in as I build up to 60 mpw this summer and then get back to 60 once during marathon block. SubT will definitely stick around as I try to mimic sirpoc's marathon plan, but with a bit less volume and about 30+ minutes slower goal.",

In the last 3 weeks, as I'm gradually reducing volume, I'll switch back to 2 Sub-T workouts with a little bit of intensity in the long run (which I'll obviously be shortening). This way, I'm hoping to get the benefit of having my second threshold in a really good spot, before entering the marathon specific month (where durability and specific MP economy will be prioritised), and then I'll aim to push that threshold back up a little in the last 2-3 weeks while tapering. That's my reasoning anyway. You might be more comfortable with your approach, but I thought I'd offer an alternative.",

So I would keep like 16 km treshold per day two times a week, with 4 km warm up each time, and cool down on bike or elliptical. Then I would add 10km in total for the other workout (plus 2km warm up), cool down bike or elliptical. Plus I would make aneasy long run at least 18 km. Son now we ran 70 km splitted in 6 sessions per 4 days, remaining 20 km that could be 2 easy runs, one per day. Now we have one day rest that could be cross country skiing. Other extra doubles could be bike or elliptical! like that we have all the most important workouts of the norvegian method but still less milage! Let me know what do u think!!",

He stopped to look at some of the frozen berries, so I decided to approach him and say hi and ask a couple other questions about his training for London. Before I could even open my mouth he turned to me, and I guess assumed I worked there, and asked if the cherries or blackcurrants were better at buffering lactate. I said \"umm I don't know\" and then clarified why I had come over. He just answered every question I had with \"umm I don't know\" and then eventually ripped open the berries and poured them into a bag of frozen peas he had in his basket and just winked at me and whispered \"arbitrage\". I saw him 10 minutes later at the checkout holding up the line by telling the 61 year old lady about his 10k time and how staying below LT2 was the secret to it all. I don't really think she even said anything, but was just being polite to a customer. He saw me nearby and then abruptly pointed at me and yelled at the store manager who was like 40 meters away that I was a bad employee who didn't know anything about the store. He paid for his shopping with a travellers cheque, turned to the guy behind him and said \"Brazil Nuts are the key\", shoved all his food into a backpack and then just shuffled out of the store yelling out lactate numbers at random intervals through the parking lot.",

    "message": "Like many here, I’ve been curious how this method could be translated to the marathon, so I’ve been watching Sirpoc’s London Marathon build with great interest. Initially I was a little underwhelmed by his half marathon result compared to his recent 10k, and took that to mean that this method may be better for 5k/10k than for the half and probably a bit less effective for the full marathon. His 10k of 30:41 corresponds to a VDOT of 70.9, while his half marathon 1:08:50 only corresponds to a VDOT of 69.5. Looking more closely at it however, I’d say the significant elevation gain on this course is worth at least a minute vs a flatter course, putting the performance much more in line with his 10k. In addition, he won by over a minute, so he clearly ran solo the whole way. He also won his 10k, but it looks like there were a few people he would have been running with for most of the race. Given the rule of thumb of drafting being worth ~3 minutes in a marathon, and there being plenty of people to run with at London, it should be a much more optimal environment for running fast. Barring a major fueling issue (unlikely given his usual methodical planning as well as his cycling background) or some unforeseen muscle cramping, I expect him to run 2:20-2:24 at London, with an outside shot of going under 2:20. I don’t want to set expectations too high, as even 2:29 or so is quite impressive for a debut and wouldn’t take away anything from all he’s accomplished so far. I’m curious to see what he does next after the marathon and when, if ever, he’ll run into the ceiling of improvement from this method.",

LRC is a toxic place with lots of smoke blown up a lot of asses but for real this is one time where someone should actually be less humble than they are. This thread reminds everyone who isn't a pro, train smart, use your time wisely , focus on the gains you can that make the difference. Plus just because we are old, doesn't mean you can't keep improving. The best part being we have been able to follow it relatively in real time, from your plateau onwards. Good luck in London. If you aren't shooting for at least 2:25, you should be!",

In my mind, it's relatively out of what you can control or at least not worth worrying about. My first run was 3km in February 2021. Pace was 7:48/km and my cadence was 176. I did a really easy run in 2024, I think it's on Strava from September , a Saturday before a race. Was like 7:10/km and I the cadence for ever so slightly faster pace was 181 average. I would say scaled to paces, it's close to being the same as it was from the start. : one thing I will add, a very helpful coach once told me after a parkrun (I think i ran like 17:54) that it would be \"impossible\" for me to break 17 ever, unless I lengthened my stide and stopped shuffling. That my comically shuffly style was meaning I was giving up kinetic energy so losing speed. Yes, that conversation really happened and I still see him every now and again at the track I go to coaching people, who pay him actual money.",

So age graded this would have been PR even. Best thing about this half marathon was that I felt the best I ever had at the finish line! 10k was pretty solid as well and also there I felt good at the finish. My 10k PR is 5 years back in the past and approaching 50 now it needs double improvement to get the finish times down. My threshold paces have come down 10-15 seconds. I measure this with lactate meter. The 5k distance though have not improved in finish times but it \"feels better\". I did not lose my \"kick\" meaning that I can still finish strong with fast last kilometer and sprint finish. But everything faster than 10k pace fells pretty brutal now. I think the fun on 5k will start IF I manage to bring my threshold pace down even further. Another 10 seconds and then I can run 5Ks and 10Ks at threshold pace close to my old PRs.",

But he's really only deviating from the core principles of the plan in the last 3 weeks before the marathon.
