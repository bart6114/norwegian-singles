    "msg": "Yes. So basically, when I see a new high point or CTL peak, I know there's a very good chance I'll probably PB. Example, I was talking about my CTL a day or so ago. I noticed last night it had crept up to 63. New highest point. I had been speaking to shirtboy over email and said I was feeling good lately (although not that feeling in my experience can tell you much, I can feel good and go not so great - or vice versa), so might do a parkrun this week; I saw that 63 and thought definitely will have a very good chance at a PB to actually back up feeling good, so got up and went out this morning. I ran 17:15 today, so I am very happy with that, another solid PB and earned my beers tonight. This again matches up to a new high running CTL. For what it's worth, when I was stagnating, my CTL was stuck around the same number and it wasn't until I really made a dramatic shift in the sessions I was doing (the shift from a more standard running approach to this) that I could raise it some more and then get back to taking some time off my PB again. Hopefully people see it's the mixture of the subthreshold sessions making it much easier to raise my training load, it's not that I'm claiming subthreshold are miracle sessions. They most likely will just get everyone to a higher training load quicker, or more importantly, higher for the same amount of time dedicated. Also, yes. I can plot just about any PB back over time , to high CTL peaks. Again, in reverse, most downturns in performance and be traced back to a lowering CTL, for a number of reasons, based on crashes on the bike or just reduced time to train and life getting in the way, or even just being bored and or life taking my eye of the focus of training. Or the third point of indexing, the point of stagnation, where I had basically maxed out the training load I could do on the hours I was doing in running originally, with the more classic training approach, and my CTL was basically staying the same. This is where you have to understand how it works, to manage it and to incrementally increase it, to improve performance again. As to your third point, I agree. Most people probably aren't understanding how fine tuned it all is and broadly entering their zones or not updating them correctly, so it's hard for them to see or understand these patterns in their own data and training. As I have a decided to use pace (as it works best for me living in a pan flat area)when you get a new PB, you obviously must update your zones etc. As now to create the new TSS, you'll obviously have to work a little bit harder than previously. For example, your estimated 15k pace to use for the 10x1k session, will now be faster. If I didn't make sure everything was updated, I'd either be given a higher TSS score for running faster, or the same TSS score for running the same speed, but in relative terms it was actually easier. This is a basic example, but where , believe it or not, a lot of people mess up. This thread is pretty funny, I'm kind of shocked it's still going and being active. I think on the whole most people have found it of good use? I also love the fact that other runners , take the time to come onto the internet and anonymously call the people who to contribute to this thread geeks 🤣 for a start, all runners are pretty geeky. I mean none of this puts us in the cool club, right? Whether it be that we train like this and look at the fine details, or just run. It's all pretty niche and nerdy either way. Here in the UK running is pretty much as un cool a a hobby you can get. So if I'm going to do something already on the nerd spectrum, I may as well get the best out of it.",

This totally depends on the workout though. If it's short repeats like 200m-400m, the impact is minimal versus a tempo run (which I don't even attempt during the summer). There are models which estimate the impact of temperature on performance. Also ones for weight loss/gain. My experience running my numbers through those is that they are similar to using 220 minus age for calculating your max heart rate... not very accurate haha I'll state the obvious and say, in general, if you can run in a good climate and run faster, that's preferable to running slower, in a less ideal climate. Heat impacts fatigue a lot more too than equations estimate, I think.

So for me you do 3Q+ 4E/week. - 35minutes sub CV is most likely more than enough, because you are close below CV (pace you can hold for about 25-30minutes). For a higher volume, the intensity should be possible reduced. However this would trigger different muscle fibers and result in different lactate levels and adaptation. Therefore, for a higher volume, a double threshold might be possible a better solution. A rest day/week and a really long run might bring an even better result. (?) I also agree with others that with your 7day-3Q/week training, an overtraining/overuse is likely in the future, because the body can't handle an increase and increase and increase all the time.

That way, it'll keep your numbers consistent proportionally to your new fitness. Daniels is fine. Tinman is fine. Just use which ever threshold calculation you started with to get to your 4:11 /km .At the end of the day it's a jumping off point for the calculations, just keep how you get to that threshold jumping off point the same each time. As far as I know, it doesn't matter what one of the zone systems you use, it's all based on an internal % of threshold within ICU. In terms of I mean, if you use runcoach zones, Friels, 80/20, makes no difference to your actual TSS score. But will change how it displays \"time in zone\" over the week.

    "msg": "Completely agree Lexel . My long run isn't long really. Which is why I put it in quotation marks. Maybe that part it's lost in translation. I'm certainly not calling it long. Its long simply in the sense it's my longest run in the week but it's very much easy. Totally agree this is an easy run in fact I aim for exactly the same pace and will result in a low HR as I do on all my other easy runs. It's totally included in the 75% of running which is, IMO, incredibly easy and not a quality workout. I am curious if you think it's running of why I'll get injured? This is my third summer running now and the best I have felt. The worst I felt and picked up some injuries was early last summer which made me change. The vo2 work was crushing me. I felt so bad on the days after it I almost quit. I just couldn't get myself going, hit a brick wall and my performance was just not moving in the right direction. I guess any runner is worried about injury. I did this same system on the bike for more years than I care to remember, over training was never an issue and of course injury chance is basically zero (except impact injuries from crashes I had in races). But my goodness, sometimes I even did 4 times a week 3x20-25 mins sub threshold/sweetspot on the bike. Never felt tired in the slightest. You just recover too fast , for it to grind you down IMO. If I was running right around threshold or above, I'd agree. I'd be crushed. But my lactate and HR is in a zone I know I can handle as long as I don't push it - and be ready to go again after an easy run the next day. But not pushing it is the absolute hardest part and the reason most people don't stick to this. I have almost religiously stuck to this for over a year now. I missed maybe 4 days in all that time, when I had Covid. Otherwise I would have had zero days off.

These are roughly rounded TSS numbers I've seen for me in the last few days. Me on 7 days Workout 76 TSS. Let's say roughly all going to be the same and just call it 75. 225 TSS via workouts for 3 times a week. 3 easy runs all at 50 TSS for 150 TSS and a \"long run\" for 75 TSS (let's just call if that for 1 TSS score a min to keep it really simple, even though I actually went 80 mins this week) . 450 TSS for the week. This is pretty much this week ( I did a park run, but let's just pretend that was a workout, and for arguments sake, the race + running there and back, weirdly just happens to equal about 75 tss anyway) Me on 6 days but one quite a bit longer run. 2 workouts. Let's say I go a bit harder, I probably could on two. 80 tss per session. 160 tss. The same easy runs, 150 TSS. nothing changes here. Then instead of 75 TSS for the long run, let's say I really push it. I could manage 105 minutes I think. So let's give myself 105 TSS. You have to remember though, this would need to be kept reasonable in terms of time, as to score the 1 TSS (roughly a minute) I would need to be going the same pace I did for 75 mins . But I managed it in theory, so I get 105 TSS. But I think that's generous, because I feel in reality I would have to dial that pace in a slight bit. But being the most generous I can, I only score 415 TSS for the week. All my experience (mostly from cycling but I'm starting to have a year's worth of running data showing the same patterns), is that I'll almost certainly be faster with 7 days and just scoring as much TSS as I can and gaining a higher CTL. Plus as I've said before it just fits in neater to the week. I would be perfectly happy with doing a slower, longer run on day 7 for more TSS as well as running the other days 3 on and 3 off, for slightly more TSS, if I could.

    "msg": "Yes, correct. Runner 2 is the runner using sirpoc’s general outline and does maintain a higher CTL over the course of the training period. As sirpoc has pointed out (and perhaps I should've emphasized this in the documents), your TSS and CTL can be compared if running relatively the same amount of hours per week. The comparison would be at what average intensity factor. However, if the comparison is between two different runners (as opposed to the same runner comparing the two different training approaches), one runner may be able to run a 15:40 5k with a peak CTL of 56 where as the other runner may run 17:30 with the same CTL. So, to clarify, I’m presenting these simulations as the same runner who is debating which approach to take as opposed to, “Method 2 yields a higher CTL so that means Noel will run faster than Liam, since he uses method 2.” As far as increasing the stimulus on the workout days, you either run more volume at the same intensity factor or run the same volume at a higher intensity factor. The choice is really up to the runner, what they are training for, what is motivating for them, etc. I like two longer threshold workouts and a long run where you incorporate some fartlek or threshold. I race mainly half marathons and marathons though, so find a solid long run more foundational. It still amounts to 3 threshold efforts and 3-4 easy days for the week.

If you find Coggan posts, in the midst of all that mess and cat fighting, there's a couple of good links you might be interested in. In goes way more in depth than simply saying the better the CTL the fitter you are, but it is looking at a world class athlete over a hobby jogger. In the sense that, overtraining might be an issue. IMO the experience of being a hobbyist in both sports I've talked about and having trained mostly like this for a long, long time - Overtraining risk is almost zero and because in the grand scheme of things, you aren't training much at all. Simply put a higher CTL is likely better. But the good news for most of us being hobby joggers, is that means as long as we collect the data well, interpreting it is also easy. Once you get past hobby jogger territory, it gets more complicated and beyond my understanding. But I know Bradley Wiggins and his team were huge fans of the PMC data.

I’ll search my drive for it if you don’t locate it. I’m still in my 30’s but think I’m reaching that point where I’m forgetting more than I remember haha One of my very few pet peeves amongst (some) colleagues is when they use their PhD to assert superiority, as if someone who doesn’t have one can’t have knowledge (whether based on experience or learned) that either contradicts theirs or illuminates a concept they haven’t considered or don’t know about. I think with running (and endurance sport in general) it does seem that practitioners (coaches and athletes) are met equally in that regard since it’s hard to argue with results. I can see why using pace based TSS is preferable to HR TSS or TRIMP (the latter two are basically the same, correct?), specifically when running intervals. One, there is the initial lag in HR to an increase in pace. Two, if HR max is reached at approximately vVO2Max, you can obviously run workouts faster than that (especially for a 1500m runner), so then, how to quantify that and work it cohesively into the model. Additionally, the variance that comes with HR in regard to hydration, time of day, glycogen depletion, etc. I’ve wanted to work on a model that both quantifies the training load, like TSS, but also accounts for both diminishing return and the training benefit you’ll receive from it (meaning how it will impact the overall “aerobic vs anaerobic” push-pull component). Like you said in regard to updating your pace data for calculating TSS, as long as the athlete is maintaining that, I think there is enough biometric data being collected that those types of systems are possible now. The general principles can come from physiology and then be updated with learned experience and real world data. Standard machine learning, really.

Also, the fact that because it actually doesn't even create as much training load, on time limited hours, its hard to find the time with the extra recovery needed to up the training load.

I actually thought the randomly generated values example demonstrated how CTL could be misused, if one is just chasing a number and giving no thought to structure.

Whether or not it results in an applicable break through, remains to be seen, I suppose. Basing training off simulation feels a bit too disconnected for me, if it's not tied to a firm foundational model of the underlying mechanism driving improvement, but I do like the idea of being better able to quantify what you're doing and determine if a positive adaption to training is occurring or if you’re overtraining and dismissing it as standard fatigue.

    "msg": "One thing I would add though, is that for me ( and quite a few other cyclists) is that there's a pattern to FTP and CTL, no matter how you got there. I've reached my peak cycling CTL on a number of different training cycles, with totally different training to get there (sub threshold was the fastest way) but my 10 mile TT times were always mid to low 18s and my FTP around 315-20. If my CTL dropped off hugely in the winter, I could also roughly guess as a % of decrease what when I did my dreaded power test in January, the condition I was in. It's definitely not linear, but I'm seeing the same patterns now in running, using basically the same principles. To make it clear, I think this basic way of looking at it is mostly limited to a time crunched athlete. As in, to take it to a basic level , I would be surprised if someone who was on 5-7 hours a week wasn't at their fittest, if they just maximised their training load whilst balancing recovery. We are 40 pages in and I still stand by that for me to do that on my 7 hours a week, sub threshold 3x a week is almost certainly the best way , whilst looking at the theory of the stress it will accumulate but also looking at my fitness progression in real life. Obviously that's only applicable to me over a year, but KI is also a very good case study anyway can go look at , because he's literally shared a couple of years of data. Way back I shared the example of me just doing the turbo for a couple of hours a day or so 7 days a week, which also got me really fit (was probably just below sweetspot). I could have easily got even fitter doing that and throwing in one or two threshold or above work. But long term, I couldn't find the time. I only did it because I was off work with a broken collarbone so had limitless time. With limitless time, a more traditional approach with lots and lots of running and a lower % of harder work, will almost certainly be better. As in a pro might double and do 4x sub threshold sessions a week + some hill work, but % wise, almost certainly less than the 25% of weekly time proposed here. It's why I've always been iffy on Seiler the more I've thought about it. On 5 hours a week, I mean really, say 1 hour sub threshold is that really all one can handle? Not in my experience.

So to the 375 you can add another 75-80 TSS which is where I've been at for a the last few weeks (that is the current TSS numbers, it was obviously less before with less reps on workout days and less time on easy runs, hopefully that makes sense and shows how I've built up from maybe 380 TSS a week to around 440+ now).

Then on the Monday , probably a very easy run. But still do 7 days a week. If it makes for anyone's interest, I'll keep trying to creep up the length of my long run like Kristoffer. I went 80 mins and just over 10 miles this weekend, the longest I've done. Will require some life planning to keep increasing it, but might be doable. So far, my progress has been incredibly steady and I'm seeing PBs at a nice incremental increase in line with CTL. Making the long run longer gradually, will increase the training load slightly faster than it has been.

Out of curiosity, I estimated an “improvement curve” so that the threshold would scale more evenly across the six weeks blocks as opposed to just discrete jumps with each 6 week update. Wasn’t really worth the extra complication haha I don’t want to shoot my mouth off too soon, but my guess, based on the mathematics of the system, would be that using an exponentially weighted moving average, particularly without bias correction (which is just a technical term to say that the CTL would start at a higher value more representative of what you are doing at the start of training as opposed to taking a while to build up to where your average is), will require a while to build up to a CTL that is reflective of approximately your average daily TSS. So, if for example, you literally scored 60 TSS every day, it would still take about 100 days to get to a CTL value that will be within a few points of where it will level off. In this case the CTL would probably reach about 56. So you’ve put in about 14-16 weeks of training at that point. Using the physiological principle of ~6 weeks for “full adaption” you’re getting to that point where, for that cycle, you’re likely not going to improve much more. And assuming, as is true for most of us, that when we start a new cycle, we aren’t starting from “zero”, reaching a high CTL within a shorter time span is completely possible. I’d definitely be open to going through you’re data though and seeing if there are any further relationships. I’d say you’re intuition and observations have been insightful.

Last week I hit CTL 172/TSS 1388 and been averaging +160/+1100 for the past few weeks. While my workouts have been going well (mainly on the treadmill), I chocked up big time on my very rocky dirt-trail 5 km race yesterday.

That is, individuals whose CTL is less than 100 TSS/d usually feel that they are undertraining, i.e., they recognize that they could tolerate a heavier training load, if only they had more time available to train and/or if other stresses in life (e.g., job, family) were minimized. (Note that this does not necessarily mean that their performance would improve as a result, which is why the word “optimal” in the sentence above is in quotes).

You will then be aiming for Friel sub LTHR zone when running. 5k a sensible distance to do race if you haven't race in while so you have baseline for work with pace. Aerobic event and doesn't take too much out of user. 1k repeats around 15k pace. If you slower than 4 min per km, just run them as time instead, 15k pace for say 3-4 mins. 1600 repeats around 10 mile pace. 2-3k pace HM to 30k pace. Again, you can these on time if repeats are too long because right now you are slow. 8-12 min range from 2k up to 3k Easy runs all below average HR of 70 % max. Long run same. Just bit longer. This seems to be up to user . Sipoc seems about 30% longer than normal easy run. I think thread agree that If you do half or definitely marathon, might be worth user going longer. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. He just like KI has been going this long time. I added spoc on Strava, very boring - just like KI. How it should be if you do this correctly.",

It really isn't a glamorous way to train, but it sure is effective. - - - - - - Steering away from \"jiggys peronal data problems..\" (Good one, gave me a nice laugh), I want to revisit the idea of comparing efforts between extreme weather conditions. Every brutal summer, I'd have easy 10K runs where my HR would creep into 170 bpm (83.7% of Max HR) at the end despite running slower than usual (even at 6:00/km pace). Where as when the weather is good, I'd need to run around 4:00/km pace to be at the same heart rate. Another example would be today's long run during which my HR kissed 181 which is supposedly my LTHR, despite the pace being anything but fast. Would you people expect/predict the internal physiological response by the body to be the same? Which one affects lactate levels more while running, HR or mechanical speed/force production?",

But anyway, I want to tell from my small jogger experience with double threshold methods and lactate pro2, it is almost impossible to spot on sessions without a device. I told many times on letsrun: once you got a device and used it many times, then you will know where are your magic numbers. Device has shown me, that some LT sessions like 20×400@5K can be less lactate on thrashed legs (and you must push harder) than 20x400@5k on super fresh legs (where you must slow down despite your ego), this is very hard to accept and understand just by your feeling without device. I kindy recommend to buy this device, it defenitely will help to understand better all your overal training and reaction of your body. Bump",

Heart rate, when compared to 60F/16C, is thought to be about 10-15 bpm higher at a temperate of 86F/30C. Additionally, it will increase as your sweat rate increase, so if you lose ~1% bodyweight in an hour run, your heart rate could be 5-10 bpm higher from that. It’s hard to get exact measurements but when you have all those factors occurring together, it is certainly not uncommon to hit a high heart rate at the end of an otherwise easy 60-90 minute run in the heat. You could weigh yourself before and after a one hour run and get an approximation of how much you lose in fluid per hour. Also, in general, assuming all else constant, higher heart rate and lactate is a function of speed (i.e. more force being applied), not the inverse.",

So if the session feels harder due to tired legs, why would that result in lower lactate levels?” Specifically, how a session can feel harder but result in a lower blood lactate level. I wasn’t necessarily commenting on the claim that the pace was indeed the same, but it could be depending how the workout is structured (i.e. sufficient recovery). To answer your question. Yes, the metabolic pathway in this case did regress in the lower glycogen state leg to more fat and less carbohydrates being oxidized as a result. The lower glycogen leg also experienced a higher rate of glucose uptake. So, no you don’t want to go into a race carb depleted haha.",

Both sirpoc and Kristoffer Ingebrigtsten have shown you can easily target paces and basically just use the lactate meter to spot check for analysis at the end. Sirpoc I believe doesn't even use the meter now I do not think and KI is only using it to check at the end of his sessions to add to his log, not necessarily to do it after each rep anymore to target. The pace ranges sub threshold being broad enough that the paces they target aren't going to crush them and their lactate is almost always under their threshold. The only difference being the newer sessions KI is doing where he is purposely going over, but this a new development. In general when we talk about KI, most and almost all his training in a good year or so was all pace targeted, sub t. If I can suggest, I would say someone such as yourself should read this thread. You clearly have messed up training goodness knows how many times and actually I think this could be a good plan for you to follow. Very uncomplicated and maybe finally you won't break and get injured. With all due respect, these guys have been doing this over a year+ non stop and are not injured and running every day.
