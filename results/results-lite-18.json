The big question is, how does this method work for runners whose muscle physiology is more balanced, or more speed oriented? I suspect it will work up to a point. But others may need to include strides and some faster stuff. There are now many from this thread following this training method.

May just be that it took a lot of time and training in general (Norwegian style or not) to make that skill transition, or maybe this specific training better suited his talent/training background in that regard, or maybe some combination of factors. I do think that there's an underrated aspect of running \"relaxed\" in workouts, beyond just getting more training in, that this Norwegian style basically forces people into while something more \"conventional\" like Daniels training doesn't necessarily do well. We think of that mostly in terms of not overcooking things metabolically (i.e. staying under the lactate threshold), but I think there's a neuromuscular aspect to it as well. To race well we need the skill of running relaxed and economically, which probably isn't trained well if we are straining at the limit of our ability in really hard intervals. Even if we are running something at a \"race pace\", if our biomechanics are strained we may not be training a style of running that is sustainable in an actual race. Doing a bunch of relatively chill tempo intervals gives us just enough stress to practice efficient biomechanics at fast paces while not being so stressful that it's hard to run smoothly. In a way, this has a sort of skill \"specificity\" even if the pace is not race-specific per se. Kinda a half-cooked ramble there but could be something to consider.",

I commonly link to this thread when someone asks some version of the \"how do I double threshold\" question, because of course the answer to that question for 99.9% of people asking it is \"you shouldn't do double threshold, but here's a good way to use some similar principles.\" While I don't really subscribe to this exact method per se, I do preach a lot of similar values in the Reddit running subs -more threshold, threshold intervals, back-off the paces slightly, anti-gut busting VO2 max intervals, anti-slugging out huge long runs, etc. In particular, a lot of people have a really tough time even considering that their heroic VO2 max intervals and huge long runs might be counterproductive in many cases, which may explain the lack of interest in a method that pretty much entirely ditches both.",

    "msg": "Excellent thoughts in these 2 posts! I agree that Sirpoc must definitely be suited to pure LT training, as most runners would at least need some strides or hills at 5K race effort or faster to perform optimally. Kinda makes you wonder if Sirpoc could go even faster with a touch of faster stuff, but as long as he keeps improving, and is enjoying what he's doing, not much sense in that. I'm a 64 year old retired runner (and current HS XC coach) with 2 total knee replacements, so I no longer run. But, I'm a devoted rower, and have been following an \"age-adjusted\" Norwegian Method plan for many months. I use a 10 day cycle that includes 2 LT sessions (one longer reps & one shorter reps), one X-Factor day (what I'd call mile-specific for a runner), and plenty of easy rowing, elliptical, biking, walking on the other days. The schedule looks like this: 1. Short LT Reps (30-90 seconds/30 sec rests. Kept @ LT effort/HR) 2. Easy Aerobic 3. Easy Aerobic: may insert a few really relaxed 15 second pick-ups 4. Long LT Reps (3-8 minutes kept @ LT effort/HR) 5. Easy Aerobic 6. Easy Aerobic: may insert a few really relaxed 15 second pick-ups 7. X-Factor Day: Generally 30-60 second intervals @ 4 minute race effort 8. Off Day or Easy Aerobic 9, Easy Aerobic 10.Easy Aerobic: may insert a few really relaxed 15 second pick-ups Repeat.... I can honestly say that while following this schedule, I never have bad days. When I first started doing this kind of training about a year ago, I tried doing a quality session every other day, but found that this led to a lot of residual fatigue (probably due to age). As soon as I started buffering the LT days with 2 easy aerobic days, and followed the X-Factor day with 3 easy aerobic days, I started feeling really good all of the time.

    "msg": "Wonderful. I hope things work for you. And maybe this will work. But I hope you know the real training \"secret\": String together a couple of years of consistent running (6 days a week), following the usual principles: sleep enough; eat right; don't add volume too fast; don't add workout volume or intensity too fast. Have cutback weeks. After a race or season, figure out the kind of break you need (full break for a week or two? Or just a couple of days off after a marathon, a really light remainder of the first week, and then 3-4 weeks of easy running with a gradual return to previous mileage? Everyone is different). You could do that with Daniels, Pfitzinger, Hansons, or some other good plan and see progress, but consistency and good habits are the key for any of those. The same applies to this method, but maybe your body will respond better to this one. And maybe you'll find that it resonates with you in a way that actually builds your ability to remain with it consistently. But there's no magic plan that overcomes inconsistency. If you find yourself caught back in the trap of doing exactly what coaches advise against (and nearly all of us have lapsed into that at least a little bit at some time), then you won't get the results you want. And although you can set goals over any time frame, remember that your job is to train exactly the way you're supposed to train today (or rest today, or whatever), according to your fitness, plan, and and the way you feel -- and to make the right kind of incremental progress by doing so. And over time, that will all add up to something you'll like a lot. The success won't just come to you years down the line, either. If you adopt the consistent approach with a view toward sustaining it over the long haul, you'll probably be surprised at your progress over intermediate stages, too. (incidentally, this probably isn't a news flash, but I think nearly any coach could turn the vast majority of 30 min. 5k runners into 24 min. 5k runners via any number of training styles if the runner commits to good, consistent training habits. You don't have a lot of people running a 30 min 5k because they follow the wrong plan; they run that because they don't follow a plan, or they don't know how to follow the plan well (e.g., \"easy means easy\"/\"train, don't strain\").",

But in my own view of consistent training, I would say the answer is less rigidly “stay at 35-40 mpw for now” than just related to following broad principles of what to do and not to do. But I suppose a lot depends on what time frame you mean by “for now,” as well as what your upcoming schedule is (I believe you have a spring goal race). E.g., I think at one point you may have asked about whether you could skip base building and head right into workouts. That would be a no. And I think you’ve had a nice attitude toward your plan of using a workout as fitness tests, but it looks like you might’ve done 5 x 1600 fairly early in your inclusion of workouts. That looks like potentially high volume early for a workout, but I don’t know: maybe you prepped your body for it over the course of weeks. And anyway, that’s water under the bridge now. And maybe settling in on mileage right now is fine. Or you could probably go with small incremental increases for a couple of weeks, do a cutback, return and maintain for a few weeks; rinse and repeat. That would be a conservative way to build. (or look at Daniel’s percentages, or just follow a plan that builds that mileage for you, or whatever). But there are lots of good options. The key is recognizing and avoiding less constructive options. And those less constructive ways usually follow the impulse of: ”must hit X goal in race Y weeks away” unless you really know for a fact that you’ve been building well toward that goal on that timeframe. I’ve mentioned more about mileage here because I was taken aback by your previous statement that you might need upwards of 80 mpw because you knew what 35-50 gets you. I suppose it’s possible that you had a really sensible view of that, but I feared that you would possibly push above 50 mpw way too soon. And I disagree strongly with the statement that you know what up to 50 mpw gets you. You had some decent results with similar mileage, but even when you got fit fast and did pretty well, you felt a little bit let down as a result of a few hitches in training and then poor pacing. And then over time, you had a series of long layoffs, sometimes through absolutely no fault of your own. And although you learned a lot along the way and made some improvements, I don’t think you have quite had the chance to follow best practices consistently in the course of bouncing back from any of those layoffs yet. And so you still haven’t had the chance to show up on the line ready to race according to the fitness you gained in training, then been able to see the results of that via a well-paced race. And you certainly haven’t been able to do that multiple cycles in a row. Doing that is what gives a runner insight into what a particular mileage range gets you. And I expect you’re all prepped and set up to find out what good, consistent training gets you. Good luck.",

    "msg": "For reference I started following the thread in December 2023. I loosely followed what sirpoc was doing, but wanted to implement double thresholds, because I have more time and wanted to try to take it as far as possible. What does it consist of? Well I do 5 x 6 minutes in the morning and 10 x 3 minutes in the afternoon on the treadmill consistently every Tuesday and Thursday, all off of 60 seconds standing. Monday is easy, Wednesday easy, Friday easy, Saturday some faster hill stuff and Sunday easy long. I scrapped the 400m repeats early on, because I just felt that I wasn't getting much threshold benefit from them due to how short the reps were, and also it just felt strange doing them on the treadmill. I haven't invested in lactic readings due to the price, but instead used Max HR and LTHR to chart these paces originally. So for reference my max HR is quite high at around 210-211, the idea is to keep everything under 190 HR at the very highest which is around LTHR (might be closer to 192-193 but I'm keeping it on the safe side). I'm taking mean readings from the last 2 minutes of every rep and aiming to keep that average per session around 172-175 for these readings. If my HR is lower than 172 consistently over a few sessions then I know its time to up the pace, if its higher than 175 then it's mostly just due to gym temperature, or bad days, but I know that I need to back off. So from December -> March I started with doing the 5 x 6 minutes @ 3:43/km at 175HR, and 10 x 3 minutes @ 3:35/km around 175 HR too. For the first 3 weeks my HR was pretty consistent at this. Then gradually lower in the 4th week and 5th week (169-171 HR), so I upped the paces of both by .1 on the treadmill. After the first month, I started seeing pretty clear increase in fitness every single week. I wouldn't up the pace every week, but it was basically every 2nd week that I was in the position to increase pace by 0.1 on the treadmill. I haven't missed a single Tuesday or Thursday session (other than 1 week which was a down week) since I started, now my paces are 3:33/km for the 6 minutes, and 3:23/km for the 3 minutes around 172-174 HR currently. I keep all of these things documented quite rigorously on spreadsheets too. For reference it comes out to around 130-140km a week, and this is very easy to sustain for me because I am not really doing anything at a high intensity, other than the hill reps which are very low duration (usually 25 seconds). I don't really feel any fatigue build up from this and can fit everything in 50 minute sessions, other than the long run. Not had any injuries either, treadmill is very forgiving. All of my easy runs are done between 5:00/km and 4:35/km. Sometimes do long runs slightly quicker but still very much aerobic (4:20/km - 4:40/km). I haven't been running for a particularly long time either, was in 40 min 10k shape in November 2022. Since December 2023, I've gone from 16:40 -> 15:40 5k shape late March 2024. 20 Y-O. Didn't run in school or at all earlier in childhood. Not ran a 10k but assuming it would be somewhere between 3:16-3:19/km just from feel. I'm not saying that this method is flawless, and it is definitely not as scientific as lactic usage. But I'm pretty confident I will be in under 15 shape by the end of the year from this, and don't really know where after that. Maybe someone will find it useful.",

    "msg": "So, for a solid four months straight, I stuck to this training routine gearing up for a half marathon. Then, in the fifth month, I tweaked it a bit to prep for a full-on marathon. Like I mentioned earlier, I simplified things while keeping the core structure intact: Monday: Easy jog for 8-11 km Tuesday: Did 10 x 3min intervals, cruising at a pace between 10 km and half marathon pace Wednesday: Another chill run, 8-11 km Thursday: Hammered out 5 x 6min intervals at a half marathon pace Friday: Took it easy again with 8-11 km Saturday: 3 x 10min intervals, just a tad slower than half marathon pace Sunday: 75-95 minutes long, a bit quicker than usual but still cruising in Zone 2. For intervals days I had 3km warm up and only 1km chill down. Rest between intervals 60-90 sec. Come February, I was all set for a half marathon, aiming for at least 1:18:xx. But man, did things go south after the halfway mark. Looking back at the data, it was clear I wasn't in top form that day. My heart rate was way too high from the get-go compared to my training days from a week ago, and I used chest strap for precise readings. Hit a 3:43 pace at the halfway mark, but the second half turned into a survival mode slog, finishing in 1:21. After that disappointing half, I had a mere four weeks to gear up for a full-blown marathon in Rome. I decided to tweak the plan by easing up on the Saturday run and stretching out the long run to over 30 km, keeping it slightly below marathon effort for 15-20 km of it. This was my third crack at a marathon, with my last one clocking in at 2:58:45 about a year and a half ago. My heart rate in those previous marathons averaged 162 bpm, so this time, I capped it at 160 bpm until the 30 km mark. Crossed the finish line in 2:54:09, and boy, did I still have some gas left in the tank. Last 700 meters, I was flying at a 3:29 pace. And get this, all of this was done with just three long runs - 30 km, 35 km, and 32 km. So, yeah, turns out this method isn't just good for up to half marathons - it works pretty well for the full marathons too. I was smashed after my first 2 marathons, but this one went butter smooth. I had no idea marathon could be that easy on the body. I was back at full training mode on Tuesday. My advice? Stick to the base training, like I did for the first four months, then maybe start prepping specifically for the marathon about a month earlier than I did to get in more long runs. But hey, I was dead set on smashing that half marathon PR just two weeks before the full marathon, so there you go! I got my next attempt at setting new half marathon PR in 3 weeks.

What I love about this thread is that the OP's first inquiry was downvoted a bunch, yet some thoughtful Letsrunners enlivened the conversation with their constructive contributions. Would love to hear more on this thread from folks who've seen success from doing this over the long term. For me, I have been training for the mile (although always been too slow for a miler) using this method, and I felt like my 1500-mile times were stagnating for a while as I raised my CTL with 3x threshold weekly – however, my 5k and above times were dropping rapidly, and my mile splits were more consistent! The instant I subbed one threshold session for hill repeats and some specific track sessions, my shorter distance times also dropped much quicker than usual. So, for next training block I am learning for myself that I can keep doing the 3x threshold to get really strong for a while, then only minor tweaks later on can give me the muscular strength/coordination to hit those faster paces. I guess what I'm realizing is that the fear I had of not improving at short distances from doing mostly threshold work isn't totally warranted – just need to add some \"tuning\" or \"sharpening\" workouts, and the times have still dropped. I used to hit the track twice weekly with threshold and hard VO2 work mixed in, but did not see the same improvement, I think likely because the mile is still highly aerobic, and much like sirpoc's early comments, my earlier CTL was much lower. My takeaway from this personal experience is that there's a layer of high-end aerobic work in the program that works so reliably, and tweaking the program slightly to meet the anaerobic demands of the 800-mile can yield great results after months of doing threshold-heavy work.
