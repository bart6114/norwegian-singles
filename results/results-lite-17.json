What do you all think of warmups? I saw in Bakken’s correspondences with Gjert Ingebrigsten that he didn’t think warmups were necessary, but I’ve seen no downside to doing them. I did another session around a grass field that I don’t know the exact distance off, and after a 25 minute or so warmup, I ran 6 reps at around 3:50 ± only 3 seconds (60s). Maybe the lower time spread was because of the longer warmup and my aerobic lactate/metabolite clearing capabilities had “ramped up” as another poster put it. I use an analog watch, so I don’t have accurate mid-rep splits, and I think I’ve gotten pretty good at feeling the necessary intensity if my reps were that close together without looking at the time/pace at all within the reps.

    "msg": "@lactate_boi Thanks for clarifying and further elaborating! I figured it was the 200m or 400m repeats you were referring to but it’s interesting and noteworthy that even for a MLSS test, below MLSS, you typically see a drop in the reading after the first test point too. @_vance With regard to your question, I don’t know how you’d target a lactate level without a meter? I’ve played around with taking my lactate curve and plugging the speeds that generate different lactate values into Daniels VO2 formula to see at what percent of VO2Max do those values occur and if they are consistent with others lactate data. There appears just too much variation for my taste to suggest matching paces to lactate levels that way though, in general. Duration plays a role in lactate too, especially when faster than your MLSS. Olbrecht has a plot (for running) that shows the lactate variation above MLSS when using 3, 5, or 7 minute intervals. While VO2 is stable for all three durations, lactate varies significantly. Conversely, Olbrecht also has a plot (for swimming) of a 6*200m w/ 30 sec recovery where the lactate drops successively with each repeat (from 4.0 mmol to 2.5 mmol), for a workout done at a pace just slightly faster (I believe 102% V4, compared to 99% V4 for the 400m, where V4 is velocity at 4.0 mmol). Point being, you can achieve whatever you want really, it just depends on the execution. As an additional point, part of the reason the initial lactate is higher and then settles (or even drops) when the pace is constant, is the aerobic-anaerobic energy contribution due to the minimal recovery. On the first repeat, you’re starting from rest, so the initial ~1.5-2 minutes is being supplied “anaerobically” while each successive repeat is being started at a higher level of rest due to the incomplete recovery thereafter, thus requiring a lower percent of “anaerobic” contribution. So, how long your aerobic system takes to “ramp up” is dependent on the workout structure.",

There will be a point where it doesn't increase the same, but on part time training, I never reached that. I've mentioned here before, but a few of us looked into it and the performance based on the worst conceivable way versus the best way to gain CTL, was only maybe maximum 10%. So in a sense, more is more , until you reach the point you are just naturally capped. I would imagine that's more hours than any of us here (in this thread anyway) are willing to put in. For running, the performance versus CTL isn't quite as neat. But, in general, we are talking a handful of seconds or maybe slightly more from my 5k time, per km CTL increase. But I don't have a huge amount of data on this - also with the caveat of I've never gone back to zero. So that's an increase from a benchmark of 40 CTL, in both ways I have trained for the same race result (a high 18). Hope that helps or sort of answered your question.",

    "msg": "The reason this has happened is his previous training was Jack Daniels based (right? or am I misunderstanding?) which means a majority of his race prep training was done at Hard Tempo (roughly half marathon to 10k effort (slower pace)), 5k pace, and mile pace. These all train type IIX fibers maximally (half marathon - 10k also trains IIb fibers very well, the other paces only slightly do this). This Norwegian Training System focuses on workouts from marathon (+) to 10k pace/effort, which trains the type IIb fibers very well, but not only that, it also , which in turn increases ability at any race between the Marathon and the 3k directly (raises your Critical Power/Anaerobic Threshold and vVO2 Max). This is also why you may feel less \"explosive\" during true base/threshold training. Your top end speed should remain relatively similar, however, your anaerobic tolerance decreases for anything over roughly 200m (150-250m depending on your training and genetics). If you don't maintain some form of speedwork, your top end speed will also begin to deteriorate. This brings me to why the Norwegians include hill sprints. Efforts faster than vVO2 Max that leave you \"huffin and puffin\" (ie 20x200m HARD Hills w/ 2x time jog rec.) actually begin to In general, as a long distance runner, this is . This means your fatigue resistance will decrease and you will become more glycogen dependent the more you do this. : This is important to understand, because if you do things right, you will increase your potential as a runner. Many people point to SirPoc doing \"traditional\" training and then improving massively with threshold training and while this \"threshold fitness\" is more suited to long distance racing and he could've done well without the harder intervals to begin with, these hard/grueling workouts were a different type of \"base\" for this threshold work. This is the reverse of \"I tried Lydiard high mileage, but I didn't race well, so I dropped my mileage and went back to my hard interval training and ran the best I ever have!\". But in this case, SirPoc dropped the hard intervals (and didn't increase mileage a ton) and improved quite a lot with Now, are these hard workout necessary to PB in 5k and up? the simple answer is , however, your potential will not increase, you will only squeeze out more from your potential instead of adding to it. If you were to add a tough anaerobic workout you may become weaker aerobically, but you will perform better at the 3k and under, while also increasing your potential at the 5k and up. Now, you might ask, and then answer is : (marathon pace ish). This does take away from your Type IIx fibers! But don't forget to train your Type IIx fibers (sprints) otherwise they deteriorate. In short, exceptional Distance Racing between 3 hours and 3 minutes requires exceptional Type IIb Fibers, you get Type IIb fibers Type IIx fibers, and you get Type IIx fibers from Type I fibers. Threshold training allows you to use your potential (in distance running), everything else increases your potential. A side note, this is why anything between Aerobic Threshold and Critical Power/Anaerobic Threshold is not always a good idea for 800m runners. As a 800m runner, you don't want extra Type IIb fibers, you want primarily Type IIx fibers, but you still want to train the Type IIb fibers you have (endurance is still important in an 800m) and you do this by training between your Critical Power/Anaerobic Threshold and your vVO2 Max, hence the 800m \"Base\" consisting of Easy Running below the Aerobic Threshold, vVo2 Max Work, and Sprint work. This then transitions into Lactate Tolerance work and such, etc. Continuing off the 800m training idea, this is why you cannot run a (relatively) good 800m when you are in (relatively) great Marathon to 5k Shape. The most obvious case is Jakob Ingebgritsen who, when running at the Prefontaine Diamond League meet, ran 3:43 in the Mile and 7:23 in the 3k. This puts him at approximately 26:20s 10k shape (in the same condtions, time trial, and rested shape). I would then estimate he could \"only\" run 1:45 (ish) in the 800m, which is incredibly fast, but slow when compared to knocking on the door of a world record in the mile. The thing here is, Jakob Ingebrigtsen is only \"slow\" because of the way he train, if he wanted to be a good 800m 1500m runner, he could be, but he would have to give up his world record ability racing shape at anything above the 3k, because he would have to convert back to Type IIx fibers (3 - 15 min race pace training). A counter-example to Ingebrigtsen is Nick Willis, who was able to run very fast 1500m races (sub 3:30), a decent 800m (1:45 when his 1500m PR was 3:32), and a lethal kick in championship races. When Nick Willis tried to transition to the 5k, he failed. This was partly because he was older, but mostly because He most likely did similar \"Miler\" training with more volume, rather than a slower pace/effort.

The addition of muscle fibers, primarily type I, has been shown and is the basic idea of hyperplasia.
