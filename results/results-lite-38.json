But his application of it's usage, I think just about everyone will agree is poor and he gets caught up chasing his own tale. I'm not a scientist or even have a very scientific mind, but I think I can communicate very well with people and apply the things I do know, to success. I'll leave that for people to decide. I'll clear up the other two points. Coggan, whilst like marmite, has probably done more for the casual self coached athlete to understand their own training than anyone in the last 25 years. Whether anyone likes that or not, that's just a fact. Even though we are on a running site, just about everyone can learn something from his original book. Lexel will never be Coggan. As much as he probably wants to be. As for Hard2find, I mean come on, do I even need to defend him? His contribution to this thread speaks for itself. There's a reason lexel messages him asking for him to disentangle his data (note lexel, this is called a joke, or and example of banter). Lexel, for the record I think deep down is a good guy who wants to be liked or respected. But, you have to do something to earn it or just communicate in a better way.

    "msg": "This thread is fascinating reading. Having ran consistently for the past 2-years and seen little progress I may have come across this thread at the right time. I have a couple of HM and a 10k booked in this year but would like to get my 5k/Park Run down to the sub 18 level (pb 18:36) but idling around the 19:30 at present. I won't be able to copy your schedule on a 1:1 basis so have laid out my plan below. I can run 6 days a week, possibly 7. Given the importance of consistency of rTSS/load on a week to week basis I'll opt for 6 to avoid too much fluctuation on a weekly basis. I plan to a schedule my week as follows (time in parenthesis). E (40) - W (60) - E (40) - W (90) - E (40) - R - W (90) Workouts initially will be 8x3, 4x6 and 3x12. The last two sessions will be in W (90). If I run a 5k on the Saturday I'll likely make the first W (90) an E (90 or 60) as a mini taper. With the exception of the two W (90) sessions the other runs have to be juggled around lunchtime at work. If I'm in the office for optics I can really only commit 45 minutes at most for a run so the W (60) session would have to be cut short albeit it is only the non-workout element that is reduced. In such a scenario I would add the lost 15 minutes of easy running to one of the E (40) runs (when I'm not in the office). From a rTSS perspective the forecasted difference between E (40) + W (60) vs. E (55) + W (45) is only 2 points, so feels like it's within an acceptable range of tolerance. The only pitfall I see is the potential for the W (90) sessions to generate fatigue which over time may require dropping a session as a refresh or cutting it back to just an hour. At the end of the day it is just running and trying to stay as consistent as possible is the most important thing and replacing a W with E run every now and then won't see my “legs fall off” or too dramatic a drop in CTL.",

It's almost like my heart needs a few extended efforts at properly high heart rates to be able to sustain it for an entire race, same for the legs and muscular endurance. When I go in solely after a long sub T block without either having done several parkruns or a couple of weeks of efforts I fade badly, almost like it's a shock to the system.

Scaled up from 5 hours a week to 7.5 and now likely 8+. If he hasn't increased volume and just had stayed the same a ability really and not improved any further. The whole point of this is you can probably increase load beyond what any other running plans put in place. Or certainly maximise or make the most of the time you have available. Many people have scaled this up or down , based on the available time you have. But the basics remain the same, you are running workouts in a sustainable way, 3 times a week. The change would be if the E-ST-E-ST-E-ST-LONG routine gets broken. Just to add my thoughts. Sirpoc I'm rooting for, but I don't think he will break 2:30 in his first attempt. I would advise him in all honesty to go down the 2Q approach for the next 8 weeks. His big base means if he started now, there's plenty of time to do the tail end of a more traditional marathon plan which will almost certainly have better results.

I'm saying yes to both. I think you have laid out 2:30 is pretty easy paced like that. I think the under/over is probably lower than 2:30. One other reason I have confidence, is the course record for parkrun he just broke. It looks a really terrible course on paper, 3 dead turns, half of it on gravel and he ran 15:41. Not only that, I am as my name suggests a Strava snoot and 2-3 of the guys who time he beat just about on that course I had a look from Strava segment, have run sub 15 elsewhere and well under a sub 2:30 marathon, actually quite a bit under.

This works because most of us are aerobically underdeveloped and speed is not the limiting factor until you hit very fast paces. Even the mile is 80% Aerobic, so working on the aerobic engine is what will give you the most time-efficient training load. ALso, easy day should be extremely easy, and there is no \"i felt good in this sub-T session so i converted it into VO2 session\". It is extremely boring, same thing, week in week out.

If you think you can buy into Coggan's fantasy world of being able to quantify load, it's been proven time and time again there is no actual way to do this. Feel, day to day, session to session and providing feedback to a professional coach will ALWAYS be a better way of accounting for load than this. Runners aren't robot cyclists and won't ever be.

I'll go with 40 mins for easy days and 70 mins for long, for now, and adjust later on, if needed.

Some things that caught my attention. Sirpoc said: 76%-79% of FTP seems quite high for an \"easy\" run to me. I think most people do easy rides (cycling is my main sport) at lower intensity than that. Those sounds like decent workouts maybe on lighter side to me rather than easy days. Is it because those runs are limited to an hour/75 minutes while cycling easy rides are often multiple hours long? I feel those being not exactly jogging pace might be something important in the system. As to TSS discussion: I feel TSS might be even better for running than it is for cycling. In cycling there are people who do more hours than pros and are still mediocre. They ride all day long at snail pace almost every day and accumulate crazy hours (for some it's work as a bike guide, for others it's clueless training and a lot of free time). I am yet to see someone doing 2-3 hours of sub-threshold intervals every week stuck at mediocre level though. You can't do that in running as there are limits to how many kms per week the body can take. This means you can't cheat the system to the degree it's possible in cycling by accumulating tens of junk miles per week. In running you need to do actual intensity to increase your CTL and then it's a question of how to do it smartly. Question for Sirpoc84: you mentioned many times you took inspirations from cycling, mainly UK Time Trialing scene. Would you mind pointing to some resources about the kind of training you have done?

You have to remember , the paces are fast ish, but if you are roughly following them within the 25% rule, taking the appropriate breaks, it's really not that hard. 5*6 mins around 10 mile/HM pace broken up really isn't that hard.

First, I find load more believable comparing like-for-like (e.g. did I build or decrease over months, given I've been running the same program the entire time), than for comparing completely different workouts. But let's ignore that for a second. I agree the race wrecks the legs more. But if you calculate the rTSS per hour, someone near Sirpoc's fitness might get ballpark ~116 for 5k pace and ~103-105 for 12-15k pace. Suppose he runs the 5k for 15:low and the reps for 31:mid. That comes out to ~85% more load for just the quality time on the 10x1k vs. the entire race. And if you have more easy running added on to the workout than the race your workout likely gives you more than double the rTSS of your 5k. Load is presented, at least in intervals.icu, as tracking both the stress on the body and the expected fitness gain. The race beats you up more than rTSS predicts; do you improve more from it as well? Is the inaccuracy in both aspects of rTSS, or does it point to a divergence between the stress and the fitness gain? If the divergence is real it suggests a major design consideration for our workouts should be how we can accumulate more rTSS without increasing recovery demand. That would probably lead us to pack on as much very easy mileage as we have time for, and to use reps to keep our lactate controlled in our quality sessions, and to separate our quality from our long run. Here's a longer cut of Sirpoc's very slow quote: > 3 easy runs a week. All under 70% of max HR which is usually about 65% of MAS for those who work in paces as well. This will keep you definitely under LT1. Long run, I tend to just keep the same and by the end I'll be almost at the upper limit of that 70% which is the goal. I think the recent studies which was excellent, on the training characteristics of long distance elite runners (2022) had easy characterised as under 70% Max HR. That seems slow. It is slow.

    "msg": "The legs being wrecked more is true in my experience, but doesn't necessarily mean it's a better training load. It's taken me a while to get my head around that. This comes down to what sirpoc was describing at the start, the hard impact and feeling of the body the real speed workouts bring, but in the bigger picture not really leading to much improvement or possibly stopping you hitting the sessions that do make the difference- note his stagnation of a reasonably decent amount of time and the boom and bust cycle others have mentioned here, before he started training like he cycled. I'm coming well around to the idea that whilst the 5k might feel harder , the 10*3 mins workout is actually banking more overall benefit AND you remain fresher. I guess here for runners around 18-19 mins or under. I think if we are talking guys slower than that, it's a different story. Also, because I bug sirpoc all the time on Strava I followed up the quote above about how 'easy' he means. The answer I got was easy means easy and is easy, in COMPARISON to other running systems daily/easy/long run days , or what might get called steady runs etc. So it was much easier than what he had been prescribed by running plans before, I wholeheartedly agree with this. In this sense he seemed to mention 80/20 or Daniels that he said were remarkably hard in comparison and would quite quickly lead to problems if he followed the medium to high end of those \"easy\" day paces or efforts. At the end of the day there is obviously a huge amount in this and it clearly works for a vast number of people now, just look at the testimonials not just here but all over the internet. I would still ask why from a scientific point of view and also how remarkable it is the balance in general for most people for the original sirpoc lay out of 3 ST-3 EASY- 1 LONG seems to work. I don't know exactly but the Strava group, here, Reddit, Facebook group I have seen dedicated to it, you have to be looking at 70-80% of people sticking to it improve over a decent amount of time as a conservative estimate. On top of that, some of the jumps from even seasoned or long time runners are almost remarkable. The bit take I can see is we are moving away from the ridiculous boom and bust cycles and allowing people to balance on the cautious side of where freshness lives which then seems to be allowing people to increase load beyond any other plan has ever allowed them before, whilst maintaining the 3 workouts which seeminglly whilst easier, aggregate in more than the equivalent of a 2Q week. I will add I am incredibly fast twitch, I saw that debate - but I also have absolutely smashed through walls and boundaries in my second life as a runner. I've run 16:33 which is almost my best from college and I'm 37 with a family of 3 to look after and all the stresses that brings. I've totally ditched absolutely everything but the 3 sub Threshold sessions a week and the easy. I was pretty happy with my turkey trot 18:21 in my 30s but absolutely delighted with my 16:33 a year and a bit on. Shout-out again though to sirpoc himself, always happy to help and answer even though I'm sure he's fed up on Strava and pushed me onto the right path when I had some questions. TL;DR of this bit, whilst I maybe took me a few extra weeks to adapt than others have suggest. This is absolutely for older fast twitch hobby joggers like me as well. Oh and good luck to sirpoc in the London Marathon . I'm also feeling good that at the ripe age of 41 he will break 2:30 at his first attempt. As long as he doesn't do anything stupid , 2:30 is almost a worst case scenario. I also don't know how many non-former elites break 15 in their 40s, but I think he will soon join that very small fraction of a % of runners.

    "msg": "For those thinking about the mile. Here's just my experience. I had always wanted to break 5:30. I was always on the cusp of it and then it just never worked out. Followed quite a few classic mile programs , all resulted in around that. Decided to focus on other things. Found this thread around 14 months ago now, to train mostly for 5k, 10k. Before this, was training in the classic cycles, 5-6 hours a week for probably a good decade. Limited success, knew my place in the hierarchy of hobby joggers. You get the drift! Didn't really think about the mile. Anyway, pretty much went down the 1:1 route as seems to be the next success of copying the sirpoc method. I call it that, as there are other ways to dial this up but I think mostly 1:1 is the best option rather than the more catchy NSM which is broader. So no hills, no strides, no 200m track repeats, just get into the meat of the routine and tick off the 3 sessions a week and otherwise just easy running. Summary, low 17 5k, mid 35 for a 10 and ran a low 1:18 HM. All absolutely blew apart my PBs. Scroll ahead to January this year, jumped in a local mile with no other thought than being annoyed it would break up my winning weekly schedule, ran 4:57. OK maybe you could make an argument for dialling in something short like the mile to really tease out a few more seconds? By what's the point. It's neglible probably compared to the absolutely huge jump I've made due to the nature of the aerobic gains across the board. And hey, it's a whole lot of fun suddenly beating people comfortably who have beaten you in all distances in the past! Also note, couldn't imagine running any other training method, where for the most part you can go day in, day out and no breaks between the seasons of cycles.",
