CV is not a fixed value, i do not define it with 30minutes, and it moves up or down based on fitness level and other things. You can use also a single race, 5k is best, to calculate it. If you train below CV you have a buffer (distance to CV) and combined with a lacate meter and/or HR or perceived effort you have a good indicator. CV is related to MLSS, it is a little bit higher (faster) as MLSS, with the original scientific definition. So basically CV is a threshold which can replace MLSS without using any lactate meter and measurement. How cool is that?",

I like data, math and science as much as anyone else in the field, but I find the idea so impractical. It's almost laughable that it's even proposed. Which to be fair, I know it likely has it's roots in cycling so they can recover from an all out effort slightly better than a runner I imagine due to negligible impact forces.

I've got those saved somewhere haha. My point though is that if you use the hyperbolic function and interpret it strictly mathematically, you can theoretically maintain CV well beyond 30 minutes, even beyond 60 minutes. In practice, that's not even close. It does generally fall around 30 minutes +/-. That's another issue, you can not only get an estimate of CV but also get an estimate of races that exceed 30 minutes (which since most of us are distance runners would be helpful) by using a function with two exponentialy decaying terms where the asymptote is likely closer to your aerobic threshold.",

    "msg": "Sorry, to clarify, I’m not suggesting my result indicated a pace I could maintain for 60 minutes or longer (it indicated 29 minutes to be exact). I’m saying that if you treat the model purely mathematically, it does suggest you can run at the CV pace obtained for 60 minutes or longer, even though in practice it is observed and recognized that you can’t. My question, acknowledging that, is why not just define it as 30 minute race pace? And I don’t mean you specifically but the idea in general. Save the 4-5 time trials and hyperbolic function for sprint and middle distance athletes and just use a single race effort to approximate CV. Also, from that race effort, you can obtain classic race distance predictions via standard methods. The hyperbolic function can’t provide that (using the 2-20 minute race effort protocol) because it asymptotes at approximately 30 minute race pace, in practice. On that last topic, I read a paper that Andy Jones published where he used 1500m - 15km times of 12 elite athletes to approximate CV and compare it to marathon race pace. That’s obviously slightly different than the 2-20 minute race time protocol but the results he obtained were still interesting. Of course, that interested me (as you say, I’m data man), so I pulled the data for the top 200 times run in the 1500m, 3000m, 5000m, 10000m, half, and marathon. Using just the 1500m - 10000m I fit the model to those 200 performances in each category, so it is an approximate average. The CV for that dataset is 360.26 meters per minute, which if you multiple by the average time for the 10km of the group works out to 9,748.64 meters, so slightly slower than 10km pace for a group that averaged 27:04 for 10km (369.55 m/min). To illustrate my point about the mathematical implications of the model though, for that group, the hyperbolic function is Time = 274.99 / (Speed - 360.26) Say you run 3 meters per minute slower than CV, so 363.26 meters per minute. The result would suggest you could run for 91.66 minutes at that pace. Using the half marathon from that dataset shows an average time of 59:16, which is 356.01 meters per minute. So obviously slower than the speed predicted, meaning it wouldn’t be possible to maintain that speed for 60 minutes, in practice, let alone 91.66 minutes. This is my point about the undesirable asymptotic behavior of the model. I hope that clarifies it. I was tempted to use more graphs and analysis but refrained… for now haha. Also, I hope this shows that I’m not being disingenuous in saying I’m interested in this concept. There are just some aspects of it that seem peculiar when going from theory to practice.",

Take the equation I provided which uses the data from IAAF for race times at 1500m, 3000m, 5000m, and 10000m. This produces the following hyperbolic function with 274.99 being the estimated D’ parameter and 360.26 being the estimate CV parameter: Time = 274.99 / (Speed - 360.26) For reference, 369.55 m/min for 27.06 min, and 356.01 m/min for 59.27 min are the speed and time for the 10km and half marathon, respectively. As your speed approaches the critical velocity speed, using the above formula, this happens: Speed = 370.26 m/min. Time = 27.50 min Speed = 369.26 m/min. Time = 30.55 min Speed = 368.26 m/min. Time = 34.37 min Speed = 367.26 m/min. Time = 39.28 min Speed = 366.26 m/min. Time = 45.83 min Speed = 365.26 m/min. Time = 55.00 min Speed = 364.26 m/min. Time = 68.75 min Speed = 363.26 m/min. Time = 91.66 min This is what I’m talking about when I say undesirable asymptotic behavior. As the speed approaches the critical velocity, the estimated time exceeds what is observed as sustainable in practice, but you are still technically running faster than your critical velocity and not violating the assumptions of the model, correct?",

I started on June 27th after 3 years of injury issues. 2022 was the worst running year of my life and I made a commitment to run at least a mile a day this year regardless of health issues. All that to say that I jumped in with very little base. I live in a very hilly area and refuse to drive the 15 miles to the nearest track, so I run hilly intervals. I have no data on threshold levels, Max HR etc, so I ran a couple of hard solo 5kms (17:30/17:20) two weeks apart and based my interval paces/HR zones off of them (I know, very unscientific, but I'm 40 and had nothing to lose if this didn't work). I run more by feel and check data post workout to make sure perception is close to reality. I have averaged about 42km/ week these past two months + a 30-50km cycle biweekly. The last two weeks of July I didn't run intervals due to time constraints. I just ran a rainy track 10km in 34:45! This training works for me. The difficult part for me is holding back at the beginning of intervals and slowing down between reps. If you're stuck in your training, not recovering between workouts, unable to stay healthy doing fast intervals, ... I would recommend trying this type of training.

    "msg": "I would like to chime in on this great thread both as encouragement to you guys to continue and to add another data point. I used this \"Time crunched, low mileage, Norwegian-Inspired\" method in 2021-22 to run a 4:40.4 mile (track) and 17min 5k (road) at age 40 after taking 20 years off from competitive racing and dedicated running. Those were the only two races I ran--the 5k in November 2021 and the track mile April 2022. After becoming fascinated reading about the Ingebrigsten and Bakken method, and how radically it differed from my HS and college \"All-out, all the time\" training, I decided to try it out myself and target a mile race at age 40 as a personal experiment/ curiosity project. Background fitness: last college track season 2003. Racing weight 160 lbs. College coach system: Vo2 max intervals on Tuesday (Huffing and puffing after each rep, long rests, basically as fast as you can complete each rep) example: 5x mile. Shorter, faster reps on Thursday with long rests. Again, each rep as fast as possible. Example 10x 300m. \"Tempo\" run on Saturday. 4 miles. AKA a 4 mile race for all but the top guys. \"Easy\" runs Mon, Wed, Fri. 8-9 miles, getting to 6:00 pace and staying there. Long run Sunday, 15 miles, 6:00 pace. Minimal exercise 2004 to 2015--work, wife, kids, etc. = 200 lbs dad bod. Recreational cycling 2015-2020 (three to five times per week with fellow middle aged dads). Not competitive cycling like Sirpoc, but spirited MAMIL riding. No power meter, intervals, etc. Annual cycling mileage during these years: 2400, 4800, 2900, 3600, 1800, 4100. This got me down to 185-190 lbs and much better cardio fitness than the previous decade. During these years I would run 0-2 times per month, usually three miles progressing from 8:00 at the start to 6:00 by the end. Decided to start the running project in earnest November 2020. Treadmill 3-4 nights per week. 4 miles at 8:00 pace. December 2020 increased to 5 times per week. Kept the same 20 mpw at 8:00 pace on the treadmill through March 2021. Bought a GPS watch with wrist HR March 2021 with the idea the point of this device is to LIMIT my pace and HR. Total mindset switch from my youth. By watching food intake, got under 180 lbs. First outdoor run with watch late March 25, 2021: 4 miles, avg 7:47, HR under 150 bpm always. April was spent gradually increasing average run to 6 miles. The word \"threshold\" shows up in log for the first time April 27, 2021--4 x 2:00 with 1 minute rest at what I felt was \"comfortably hard\", around 6:00 pace. At this time I decided I had better define my paces better, so I ran an all out 1 mile time trial on May 3 in flats on a hardpacked dirt road--5:15. I then used the online Tinman calculator and plugged in 5:10 mile as the reference, figuring a race on a track in spikes was worth 5 seconds. Spent May to October 2021 trying to build gradually and avoid injury, eventually finding the regimen that fit my work/kids schedule: Mon: Threshold Tuesday: easy Wednesday: OFF Thursday: Threshold Friday: easy Saturday: easy Sunday: \"long\" aka usually 10 miles; minimum 8, max 12miles. My threshold sessions were most often intervals of 3:00 (min 4 reps, max 8), 4 x5:00, or 2-3x 10:00. The rest was ALWAYS 59 seconds--to make sure I kept the intensity low enough that instead of panting and wishing for more recovery as in my youth, I was raring to go by 60 seconds. My easy runs were NEVER allowed to go faster than 7:00, usually above 8:00. I often did 10 x 6-8s hill sprints/bounds after these easy runs. Long run usually averaged 7:00 pace. The most important points about this training was how EASY it was, and the complete lack of DREAD. Unlike my youth, no need to get psyched up for the workouts, and no no need to dread the gut-busting next interval because there is no gut busting with this system. Time for bed now, but if you guys are interested, I will post my exact log with workouts and weekly mileage.",

For my 10 and 5 minute threshold intervals I would wear the nike streakfly or the adidas takumi sen. For my 3 minute intervals I would wear the nike dragonfly spike. It was amazing to run a session like 8 x 3:00 threshold with 1 min rest in SPIKES and feel absolutely fine that day and the next. No soreness in the lower legs at all! Doing a session like that, or any track session really, in my early 2000s Kennedys or ventulus would have left my legs trashed. I also tried doing some of my easy runs in the nike zoom x invincible, but they were so huge and clunky I didn't like them and did most of my easy volume in a \"normal\" trainer like a saucony kinvara.

One thing I will say, is the debate is fantastic , but keep it simple. If you don't or won't or can't use a lactate meter, I still stand by the paces roughly I started with posting. I've helped a good few people out, the reps from 1k(3-4 mins) up to 3k+ (or 10 mins) seem to be working the best. As long as you know your current fitness, a good starting point is still 1k reps at no faster than 15k pace, 1600m reps at a fraction slower than 10 mile pace, 2k reps at HM pace up to 25k pace - and 3k reps around 25-30k pace. This as a starting point. You might find it shifts a little per individual, but having helped a few people now, I don't think those as a starting point, has sent anyone into the crazy spheres of being trashed. Obviously the number of reps is important, but stick still to around a max of 25% sub Threshold over the 3 days ( in terms of time in zone) of your total weekly volume. So if you are doing maybe 5 hours a week, but then you start trying to run 10x1k , you'll obviously wreck yourself. 5 hours a week, would be 75 mins total spread across 3 workouts, 5.5 hours would be 82-83 mins, 6 hours 90 mins- and so on. Less than 5 hours, probably isn't going to work. There's probably a cap on doing this in singles, that's probably 8+ zone. Easy runs still cap at an absolute max of 70% MHR to make it even more simpl, rather than starting to talk about MAS. If you want to begin and just try this out for 4-6 weeks, I honestly don't think you need to over complicate it more than this as a pure starting point. Considering we are 50 pages in, that's still relatively simple. Once you get past that stage, then maybe start to dig around in the weeds and tweak things a bit or looking into the training metrics and stuff talked about.

To me, it’s that the prediction for the duration, without violating any of the model assumptions, suggests you can maintain CS far longer than is actually possible. Even if you ignore that inaccuracy and accept that it is not the goal of the model to provide both a speed and a duration (either time or distance) for the CS, are you not left with the conflict created by stating that the CS determines the boundary between the severe intensity domain and the high intensity domain? Yet, because that speed which demarcates the two domains is CS and the model suggests it should be maintained for X minutes, X should also mark where the severe and high intensity domains reside. But that would be a point that, again, in practice is observed to be unrealistic. Is that not a perplexing discrepancy? I don’t want to go on about it here as it is not the theme of the thread. Also, maybe this has already been addressed but I suspect not, since I assume you would have said so? I’m going to start a thread on this topic though, as it’s curious to me (not so much in application but conceptually) with the hope that maybe some exercise physiologists or better informed individuals than myself will chime in. In an attempt to summarize this concept though, as well as provide some more “grade school graphs” to the participants of this thread, I put together two documents. One is an overview of the critical speed model with some details not identified in the papers and videos I’ve seen. The second document uses VDOT to not only provide CS paces for all VDOT values but also identify the duration CS can be maintained based on a runners VDOT value and at what percent of 5km pace it occurs. P.S. The second paper may also be of interest to undergraduates in applied maths and sciences, as a project. There’s some interesting ideas and applications, I think. Most especially if additional data were added to the mix. If, despite the lottery winning level of probability, someone does find this interesting, I can post the code (python) used to generate the results.",

    "msg": "So, the assumption I made was that while the hyperbolic model can’t predict the duration at critical speed, the critical speed value itself, which is estimated using the 5 test results in the 3-20 minute time frame, is the “true” critical speed. Therefore, that’s all that is needed from the hyperbolic model. From there, using VDOT, you can calculate the percent of VDOT that the CS occurs at for each VDOT value, then using an iterative algorithm (Newton-Raphson Method in this case) calculate for what duration of time that speed can be maintained. I’ll go through again though and read the code to make sure it executed as I conceived it. The appendix goes through what I did specifically to generate the calculations. I realize the math may not be accessible to everyone (which first assumes that the document itself is of interest to anyone haha), but part of the reason I included it at the end was, for those who are interested and can follow along, feel free to call me out if you think I made an error or an improper assumption. I’m more than willing to answer criticisms, as long as it's constructive. Btw, lexel, I produced A LOT more data than I included in my “document dump” haha. If you want, I can send it to you? I pulled data from IAAF too and calculated a bunch of athletes critical speed curves but also fit performance curves to their race times from 1500m - marathon. Plus, I have additional data from the VDOT calculations. Let me know. One other idea I had was to create a performance curve based on 1500m, 5000m, and 10,000m times (since those distances are frequently raced), then use the values estimated from that curve, at the same time intervals as I used in the VDOT document, to construct the hyperbolic function. From there, I could test how similar the VDOT values are to what the athletes have actually run. Maybe I’ll give that a go this weekend haha",

The IAAF are more “generous” in the race times that they consider equivalent. For example, System: 5km, 10km, Half, Marathon IAAF: 17:30, 37:32, 1:23:49, 3:05:35 VDOT: 17:30, 36:17, 1:20:14, 2:47:41 I do tend to think Daniels can be a little fast with the predictions the longer the race distance goes, but mainly because most people do not run enough mileage to be “equally” trained for the longer distance as they are/were for the shorter distance, not necessarily because it's physiologically impossible. Also, the longer out you project, the more variability, in general. I tend to think the reality lies somewhere between those two equivalencies, for most people. It’s a good point you make though, regarding the basis used for prediction. P.S. You have very different D' values for your VDOT than I do, which I assume is due to a difference in the sample size and/or range of the test protocol used to estimate the CS and D' parameters. Maybe we can dig into that over email. I have a table that shows the percent difference in the estimated CS based on the number of tests 3-5 and the range of times used.

It has to do with what I mentioned previously about the IAAF having slower equivalent times than Daniels as the distance gets longer, plus the way you estimate the parameter D'. D' = d - cs*t , where d is the average distance and t is the average time. Since you're using the same distances with different times, d will be constant throughout your calculations. cs and t are the variables changing. Since the times for IAAf are slower relative to the same starting distance (say 1000m using your data) than Daniels, the CS calculation will be slightly slower for the IAAF data. That also means the average time, t, will be slightly higher than compared with Daniels. It's a very marginal change but that results in an increasing cs*t term, compared to Daniels which decreases as the performances get faster. And thus, since the average distance for IAAF and Daniels is constant, subtracting an increasingly larger number from a constant results in an increasingly smaller number for D'. Hope that helps.",

Still, it seems like the Norwegian approach is best suited for 1500-10k (you know, the distances that the Ingebrigtsens run), and there's no substitute for high mileage for the longer stuff. Since threshold is pretty similar to HM race pace, I thought I could benefit doubly from maximizing the volume I ran in that zone. I now think this was a flawed strategy, and I was essentially making the same mistake as a 5k specialist running all his workouts at VO2 pace.

However, I believe this works better for the reasons that I have gone into. Firstly, Seilers version of polarised training is actually more like 85/15 when you see the actual studies, even more like 90/10 for the absolute elites, whereas what I am doing is about 75/25. In simple terms, in isolation the Seiler style \"hard is hard\" sessions that account for the 10-15%, are definitely harder. But, you can't do as many of them in a week. So if you stick to his rules for the 75% (under VT1), but replace the 25% with manageable runs that are reasonably hard, but easy to recover from, you can generate more TSS weekly. It just happens sub threshold, ticks all those boxes, once you work up to it, 3 sessions a week are pretty easy, I've done this now for almost 16 months, every single week in that time. In the spirit of the thread and pure simple terms, the 25% (+-2) in this system is simple worth more (training load) than the 15% in Seilers classic polarised approach. FWIW, Seiler himself has backed down a bit on this lately, as he lives in Norway and clearly Jakob is changing things. Previously, he was basing most of what he was applying from Norwegian cross country skiing, or that was at least his starting point. As I've said before, this is nothing new, Time Trialists in the UK have been training like this for a while, it just seems that for me at least, it translates well into running.",

And that does not mean this is the optimal training distribution. This is important to understand. What works for one, does not need to work for others. Seiler made his analysis too simplistic in my opinion. He has only 3 zones. 3 Zones are not enough. Seiler counts everything below 2mmol as Zone 1, however it is a difference if you train at lactate baseline (around 1mmol for most) or close below 2mmol. That is not the same effort, recovery time is different. He missed an important information here. And on the high end he does not use CV as a marker, he uses typically 4mmol as a marker between his zone 2 and 3, This is also not optimal, as the Norwegian model lands close below CV as outlined by me in very detail. So is see your approach not all in the Seiler way, because Seiler simplified it too much. In the K.Ingeb. system, which you copied and presented here, easy means very easy, staying at the lactate baseline, and quality is close below CV, and there is no other training in-between. That is the polarization i am thinking off.",

I bring in Coggan, because despite the fact he has become almost a parody of himself and an internet troll on the time trialing forums at times, we can apply a lot of his metrics here. But if you speak to Seiler, he will tell you it cannot be polarised this way, from a pure definition point, in the sense that the word itself means opposite ends of the spectrum, whereas a lot of this training sits more in the middle of a scale. I actually think you could just call this sweetspot training, as it's clear it's much like the cycling power zone that is specifically designed to create as much CTL, without crushing you. That's basically what is happening here, just without the use of a power meter - and obviously the impact of running means we can handle less (for instance I could easily rack up 100 CTL on the bike, but 65 now from running probably feels as hard, if not more than generating 100 cycling). I've spoken to Hard2find quite a bit about this and there is definitely an opportunity for someone, somewhere to make something better to apply to running. Using TSS I still think works for running, but probably only if you apply it to this model of training. It still totally underrepresents the really hard sessions. But then again, NP on the bike can be manipulated and broken, so maybe nothing is perfect, but I digress. I wouldn't say it's fair to say I copied KI, I noticed he was doing something similar in terms of running that myself and others had been doing for over a decade in cycling. But he certainly inspired me to just go back to basics and have the confidence you can of course train like this, with relative success, not just on the bike but running. FWIW, I've not seen enough people doing this long term in running to comment, but absolutely nobody I encountered on the UK Time Trial scene didn't increase their FTP if they stuck to this as their training method for a decent period of time. The Strava group is interesting, which is why I haven't posted here much, as you can see who is training this way and their successes. I also agree with you that 3 zones Seiler presented isn't enough, again they have changed over time. I think he's more in line with a 5 zone model now. Obviously as you say, saying anything below 2.0 mmol is ridiculous to say that's \"easy\" and zone 1. If I ran the top end of that , each day, I would be totally and absolutely crushed and there is no way I would be able to run the 2.5-3.5 mmol sessions 3x a week I target. In fact, I suspect I would get injured or something if I ran 4 days at the top end of Seilers zone 1 and then tried the 3x sub threshold days.",

I had a pretty bad race and probably now I'm going to do a block of this training. He mentioned Jiggymeister who committed to a 26 week block? Also that jig was racing but didn't know yet how he had did? Does anyone else know how jiggy went? I think he was more nervous about Jiggy race than his own was the impression I got. Maybe the sign of a coach ? One thing I will say as addition is I think his time could have been faster. I was in the elite/club runners group but he was in with the masses. He must have overtaken hundreds and hundreds of runners to get up near the front with the top 100 guys or so. He seemed a bit just OK with his time, so maybe he expected more? Also he does sometimes check this thread, but often is more active in Strava group and a WhatsApp group. He seemed very miffed and baffled that anyone could be interested in his Strava.",

    "msg": "Hello, I just quickly skimmed through some of the thread, and I have a few thoughts for consideration, and some articles that some here may find interesting, before I eventually get around to reading the whole thing. Please ignore anything that is ad nauseam at this point. There is evidence supporting CP/CV as the new gold standard for defining the threshold, over the (quasi) maximal lactate steady state, which tends to be ~4% lower with the common 30-minute protocol. This difference largely seems to be due to the short trial durations used to calculate CP/CV, which have less built-in fatigue than MLSS. However, this could still be useful to define a subthreshold effort, and the single visit protocol for MLSS may directly equate to CP/CV so then they could be used interchangeably, in addition to it already being 'close enough' for the purposes of training. Regarding LT1, my view is that Seiler et al are wrong to consider this a threshold in any real sense of the word because it's inherently above baseline yet not a functional threshold, like LT2, which we know is basically where the wheels fall off the bus in distance running. To me, it seems to be through protocol an arbitrarily selected point on an exponential curve that increases with intensity. Furthermore, it seems inappropriate to call <LT1 low intensity and >LT1 high intensity, like if you get 0.5 mmol/L over, you suddenly jump to the other end of the intensity domains. The 80/20 guideline isn't nearly nuanced enough as a prescription for any athlete; if put into a 3-domain or zone model, then 80/20/0 is completely different than 80/0/20, yet both are 80/20. Additionally, elites tend to do their easy runs ~1 mmol/L, not ~2 or 0.5 over baseline, so it's mostly semantics unless you subscribe to the \"zone 2\" ideas of Tadej Pogačar's fluffer(Inigo San Millán) , which I remain skeptical about until he actually defines it physiologically, instead of the whole thing being an ad for his coaching services. To his credit, Seiler's greater idea of \"keep easy, easy, keep hard, hard\" can be made to fit the Norwegian model with the simple addition of \"keep moderate, moderate\". I am not sure how well his ideas of polarization by session intention have held up over time and as others noted, he pulled back from this, but I digress.",

Do we really think the main guy we talk about here other than jakobs older brother really ran a low 56 for 10 miles when he was barely breaking 19 mins a year ago? It also sounds like he was a 19 runner for a while so it wasn't like he was just passing through that marker. That would almost equate to a low 16 5k this 10 mile he supposedly run and probably on cusp of being a 15 runner. It just doesn't seem plausible on this kind of basic training. When I see something too good to be true, it usually is. Yes, I could accept it maybe if going from a 25 down to a 22. But returns will diminish sub 19 especially and to almost find 3 minutes when then doing zero speedwork or anything runners have done that we know works, well I just don't quite believe it. Maybe we are missing something we aren't being told? I can believe he stays healthy as this doesn't sound hard. It's easier than my training. I just don't believe it would make anyone fast. This isn't doubles, this isn't particularly high mileage. This is absolutely basic stuff.",

By his own admission, he has never publicly defined it, and it is his trade secret. Certainly if my fatmax was 40% of VO2max, as it is in some people, he wouldn't have me out there walking, right? Not to get too far off the rails with this. LT1 and \"the talk test\", which equates to being near VT1, is often taken as the surrogate for ISM's \"zone 2\" by his acolytes and it is generally accepted as the end of the moderate exercise domain. My point is that we shouldn't get too caught up in doing our easy runs near it, especially if the rest of the runs will be subthreshold/tempo because they are fairly close in terms of intensity. The issue becomes, \"Well then, how easy is easy?\" AFAIK, there are no real physiological anchor points below the first metabolic turn point we can use as a reference, zone 1 in a 5-zone model is 100% arbitrarily determined. It's somewhere at lactate baseline, below a ventilatory inflection point, etc. A percentage of a maximal anchor point like VO2max, HRmax, or Wmax doesn't tell us where our domains are in relation to it. % of CP or MLSS doesn't tell us where the first turn point is in relation to it. Maybe % of VT1, LT1, or GET could work, but I can't see that becoming too popular. That leaves subjective descriptors like RPE which aren't really that helpful and all of this says nothing as to what is the optimal easy intensity.",

However, this standard MLSS definition is arbitrary as correctly The maximal metabolic steady state: redefining the ‘gold standard’', also referred by you above in post #1062. To find MLSS you need a lactate meter. That does not mean a lactate measurement during or after a quality session or by a ramp test, is wrong. CV offers a performance indicator which is in my opinion easier to get, and you get an athlete profiling. And there we are, 10K pace is basically CV pace for Pro athletes but not for amateurs as they need longer to run a 10k. So 10k pace is close below CV for most, and yes a good starting point for the Norwegian method. However, the underlying, lets call it theory, goes deeper.",
