Of the one that had 20, they could not even do all the tests because of COVID, but still made conclusions nonetheless. From the second article: \"A major limitation from our study was that COVID restrictions prevented a single time trial. Thus, for our outdoor trials, participants encountered varying running conditions that we are unable to control for such as different weather, temperature and courses. Nevertheless, even with this limitation, CPSTRYD was highly predictive of outdoor performance. It must also be noted that our runners could not have feasibility raced one another in any meaningful way. Even a 1500 m track based time trail would result in some participants being lapped more than once. We believe this heterogeneity of our population can also be considered a strength as runners are not a homogenous group and running power will appeal to many runners of different abilities. Predictive measures such as VO2peak are more predictive of performance in heterogenous populations [33]. A homogenous group such as elite runners would be likely to generate weaker relationships with Stryd than we have found. This also warrants further research. One possible limitation is that we did not determine MLSS and this also would be one area for further research. Also, a possible limitation is that while CPSTRYD was statistically equivalent to CPCALC, some participants recorded differences between the two estimates. Coaches and runners need to remain aware that CP estimates are highly influenced by both trial protocols and the mathematical models employed [15]. Even when using the same protocol and model a ~5% day to day variance should be expected\" So a 5% variation day to day is expected between a normal CP estimate and the Stryd algo, but you think HR is very unreliable?",

Whilst I'm sure, there's less varied frontal dynamics in running over cycling, it still poses a huge issue. For me, when I'm running into the wind at pretty much the same effort as with the tailwind, the reading is different. Say 275w versus 325w. Whereas on a bike it would obviously read 300w both ways. The issue being, you can't say it averages out, as you will be running into the wind, for longer than the tailwind, so even over say 1k in each direction, your data is flawed. Maybe I'm missing something, but I don't see any way to change this. Whereas with a cycling power meter, this isn't an issue. It has no idea or anything other than the force going through the cranks or pedals (depending on what meter you have). In fact, you can actually then do the opposite, which is calculate your CDA based on power, versus conditions , wind, crr, etc. so it's actually really useful and obviously repeatable. The issue with my wrist power, is ironically it seems to be better at into the wind versus out of the wind. But it's incredibly reliable on the watches elevation data. My Garmin, sometimes spikes in elevation. Which obviously is a huge issue, as suddenly you are doing 500w. You can smooth the data out in golden cheetah after (which I've done) but ultimately, on the go it makes the readings useless, or at best no better than HR or pace. It's unfortunate, nothing is ideal and I wish power is better. This is coming from someone who used exclusively power for cycling, to the point I didn't use any heart rate data for about 5 years. But the usability for it for running, that whilst fun and interesting to play with (I've collected so much data), I wouldn't be making it my primary tool, as much as I want to.

They won't mind me mentioning them I hope, but Shirtboy for example, probably for him the best metric he knows and can guage based on his circumstances is HR. For Jiggy, based on his circumstances actually lactate testing is probably best to shape or spot check sessions, due to his extreme climate (then to pick one of the other metrics, to shape TSS per session to compliment). There's nothing wrong with that, we literally can work with that. That's 3 people, in different parts of the world, but we are all roughly doing the same thing who feel this is working. If, we were all riding our bikes, we could probably all do our riding inside (or most of it, it's obviously more efficient use of time) and almost certainly, power would be the best metric for us all to use, simply because across the board, it's going to be totally consistent. We could all use 3 different power meters in this pretend world, which would potentially all read different (250w isn't necessarily 250 actual watts) but the principle stands, that individual power meter is highly repeatable for us and you can really dial it in. I just cannot do that with a Stryd. It might work with some, but it just won't for me. So it's not the blanket solution here . Yet. I hope that changes.

To be clear though, sufficient wind force would impact velocity and thus running power but it probably doesn't greatly impact the accuracy of the calculation of Stryd's critical power model since that would be averaged out in the mass of data they collect. I believe that means you would really only have to worry about it in fairly windy conditions if you were using it as a measure of intensity and then trying to train exactly at your critical power without RPE as the deciding factor. The same issue applies to using pace. Anyway, I don't think my watch uses either the barometer or weather reports to try to take wind into account but I've been using running power for weeks and found it to be very consistent across different conditions and grades all the same.

    "msg": "Sir Poc, my friend :) Running speed and power is equivalent in a flat and unwindy situation. However this changes if there is wind and if there is an altitude change (e.g. hills). So if you have headwind and you keep your pace, you need more power to run forward. Power value increases, but the speed is the same. The opposite is true with tailwind, if you keep your speed constant. Therefore power is better as speed in theory, leaving the measurment problems of a food pod aside for a moment. In cycling you train by power, and if you catch some headwind you keep the power, but by doing so your speed gets slower. Hope my englisch was good enough to explain it in an understandable way :)",

    "msg": "Lexel, maybe I explained it not great myself, that's not the issue. I can run at the same effort (power) but the power displayed isn't the same. That's because the Stryd in the wind, doesn't calculate my CDA correctly. If there was zero wind, it works fine. If my cda fitted into the algorithm, it would work fine. My frontal area is obviously less, than it predicts for my height versus weight. My effort is the same both ways , it should be 300w both ways (just to use an example), no matter what my speed is, but it just doeskt work out like that. I can run at HM effort which I have dialed in, and it'll widely vary both ways, even though the effort (not pace) is basically the same. This is easily replicated with force, like a cycling power meter of course. But the Stryd isn't measuring any force. It's using velocity, acceleration , terrain, wind to estimate what the force would be. But the issue is, it needs an extra calculation that a cycling power meter doesn't, it requires to guess or estimate what the users frontal area will be or is. I simply don't fit into this. I would guess I have narrow shoulders for my size, as my cda recorded on a bike is incredibly low, like 0.14 with crr taking into consideration. I've used aerolab in golden cheetah to test this on the bike, so my assumption is reasonable I think that I'm also more narrow than what stryd thinks the average person for my weight and height is. (again, this is a huge advantage of a power meter on the bike, you can actually use it to test aerodynamics and which equipment is faster, but that's just an aside, not the issue here, but another example of why measuring force through the cranks or pedals, is superior). This isn't a massive issue, it's just another tool anyway for now running power. Obviously having 10 years of cycling power data, running to power would be great. But we just aren't there yet. The wrist sensor on the Garmin seems better, in the sense I think it's probably estimating a lower cda, that works better for me for the same HM pace effort both ways (although it reads 400w, who cares about the actual numbers). The main issue being, the elevation spikes wreck the data when running live. But that's now the power algorithms fault, it's the actual watched elevation data.",

I used to drop 1% off each from 95% and 100% to account for the extra motivation and boost you get from a race opposed to training (a bit like the friel test). This always worked out. You could also just do 20 mins or an hour . That also works. It doesn't really matter, as long as you stick to the same way you calculate FTP each time. It's only useful to you anyway, not anyone else. This is despite the many arguments people have gotten into with coggan over the years. Where he insists FTP is only valid as a 40km/25 mile time trial. But any of the above in my experience works, just stick to one. The other issue with the 25 mile TT, is for me I can do one in 48 mins, for someone else an hour.

    "msg": "Hopefully as we have really gone in deep on this, some people might find this interesting. So for my normal schedule, over 6 weeks, I ran with the wrist paced power set up, linked to my nearest weather station 1 minute before I started the run and pressed start on the Garmin. This was a mixture of easy runs, long easy runs, 10x1k , 6x 1600 and 3x 3200. My FTP was set up with the assumption ( this is what I will continue to use) that a 5k is equivalent to a 10 mile TT or 20 mins and that 94% of that will suffice. It's not my real FTP, it's just a guess like anyone really but that is going to be my protocol from now until the end of time. For what it's worth, I always used this when cycling and my 10 mile PB is near 18 min flat and my 5k is around 17 mind flat. So in terms of aerobic effort, they are very close. We can argue on the 94%. If coggan was here, he would argue. But I've known plenty of people use this and it works over time. FTP is only relevant to me and the only thing I consider important really is it's in the range of realistic and highly repeatable in how I work it out. Anyway, onto the data. So all my runs are either giant loops, or out and back repeats with an even number of runs into the wind and back or vice versa. I thought I would add that in. So here is the huge issue. The watch based power, requires elevation in its calculations. Whilst that is usually accurate, as part of this testing I recalibrated manually before the start of each run. However every now and again there might be a random 5 foot spike up or down ( just as an example) despite clearly me being on a flat, sea level plain with literally the sea at eye level to my left or right, during the run. So you would get a huge spike (or decrease) in power for a short duration, if you were looking at the power gauge in real time. This would obviously completely skew the data, over say a relatively short 1km repeat. However, the caveat to that, is when it measured the elevation as pan flat, say picking HM effort (not pace) as the example, it measured the power VERY accurately both ways, compared to the styrd. So it must accept my frontal area as less. Again, this must be factored into the equation, as it has no actual idea of the force being applied. So the \"power\" number is just an approximation of a giant algorithm, rather than a mechanical measurement. Note, if anyone ever tried the Cyclops \"chest\" based cycling power meter about 10 years ago, it reminds me slightly of this. Sometimes it plays ball, sometimes it doesn't. Ok, so the problem. How to deal with the spikes. What I did was load all my runs into golden cheetah and use the editing software to flatten out the spikes in elevation/ power That's when things became much more interesting and usable. All easy runs then fitted neatly into between 76-79% of FTP. All 1k repeats were within 102- 103% of FTP. All 1600 repeats were within 99- 100% of actual FTP . And 3200 repeats were within 96- 97% of FTP. This suddenly is incredibly useful information on a narrow range that is working for me. The pace was a bit scattered, so in this sense power is a much more useful and narrow margin of error metric to use. Ok, so the big problem. I had to smooth out all those power spikes. It had zero use to me on the go or in the session in real time. Sometimes, before the data was smoothed out, there could have been 20w difference between workouts of the same duration. So on the go, really I would have no idea where I am. Anyway, I found it incredibly helpful to look back in retrospect. It's just such a shame, there is no way to see it with this accuracy in real time. A final note, these are \"harder\" than cycling sweetspot zones. But the final say on that, cycling sweetspot you might do 3x 15 or 3x 20, so in a lesser percentage of FTP range, (96% was the lowest I did in running) which is offset by the longer reps and for a longer amount of time. Whereas in my running, they are shorter but a little bit harder, even the 3ks are probably 5 mins shorter than any sweetspot reps I would do on the bike (where I would target maybe 89- 93% of FTP).",

I ask because it seems like the amount of time spent at the appropriate pace puts all runners in a similar lactate state, whereas if a slower runner has to spend 90 seconds covering 400m, for example, doing 20 reps is going to tax them a bit more than Jakob, or one of the guys running a 17:00 5k. It seems to me that if you're running at the appropriate pace for a given interval, running for longer just to reach a specific distance means more time than others spent at a given level of threshold, and thus a higher lactate mmol value. The faster you are, the less time you'll spend at any given pace, and I've just been thinking that since time is the factor with the longer distances, maybe that should be the goal for all paces. I do understand that many have come to view 6-minute intervals as circa 2000m, and 3-minute intervals as circa 1000m, but looking into the Norwegian training, they seem to emphasize time over distance, except for the shorter 400m intervals and hills. Alternatively, of course, a slower runner could stick with the 1000m or 2000m distances, and just do fewer reps. I'm wondering what all of your thoughts are on this.",

Interesting to know that sirpoc has stopped doin the 400m intervals. I will definitely take this into consideration, as injury prevention is my number one aim.
