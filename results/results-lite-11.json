So not 5k pace, but what you miss out in top end speed is made up for with much more volume at faster paces (you could easily clock 20km at HM pace and above in one week - no one is clocking 20km a week at 5km+ pace under traditional plans) 2) Running at or above VO2max is not the only way to stimulate improvements in VO2max. Whilst running at the paces specified may not be such an intense stimulus, they are easier to rack up volume and recover from so the loss of some stimulus is balanced out. I'm not the individual that prompted your comment, so I can't comment on their progression. As a cyclist though they did clock an 18:xx 10 mile TT before coming to running.

    "msg": "I think that is why the discussion has irked people. If they aren't elite, then their 5k time is above critical power and their 10k time is below it, so that would basically be their 'max targeted subthreshold' pace served to them on a platter. Unless they want to train/race exactly at threshold or use it as a metric to track their progress instead of race results, which are truly the gold standard measure of performance, then they probably think it's just a distracting academic matter. The functionality of it all is getting a bit lost. Putting aside how much the duration of the exercise impacts the intensity domains, which perhaps, is best measured in the field using a lactate meter towards the end of the session. They are too impractical to provide the constant data required for highly accurate training under normal training conditions. You wouldn't, for example, whip out a lactate meter while running up a mild hill just to check that you are not over an arbitrary lactate value. So let me make an argument for running power, or perhaps running velocity. For starters, running power is consistent enough to be used directly as an intensity gauge without getting into the whole debate about whether it's a true measure of power. It's much more responsive than HR. As shown in studies on Stryd, it can be used to derive CP/CV with good accuracy without doing specific time trials, provided there is enough variety in training data(outdoor or indoor). The derived threshold value can be kept up-to-date with no effort by the end user, without them doing any all-out efforts, races, or even anything at threshold. What I find interesting is that they're eventually going to be able to use stress scores, historic data, weather information, and a complex algorithm to account for all environmental conditions and, for the most part, the state of your body, in order to remove their impact on running power and velocity. You would be able to directly compare a cold, snowy, hilly run in a state of overreaching to a run on a flat surface in perfect weather with fresh legs. Take this all with a grain of salt because I actually haven't done much testing on this and I'm still a luddite. Most times the watch is at home or being plainly ignored until I look at the data after the run. I did try COROS' Effort Pace but it just managed to distract me since it's delayed by like 10–20 seconds, but in essence it's a customized Grade Adjusted Pace that tracks with power.",

Thus he's probably got a hell of an aerobic base (plus talent) to work from (think capillaries/mitochondria/heart etc), so the improvement is likely much larger/quicker than the run of the mill athlete can expect. Similarly, I saw Tom Domoulin cracked out a 32 min 10k the other day, not bad for a cyclist! In terms of rate of improvement, he's not alone benefiting from threshold interval focus, this year my hobby jogger partner (female mid 30s) has gone from 39 down to mid 36 for 10k (on a hot day!) typically averaging ~45-50 mpw, by doing threshold sessions twice per week, long run, plus strides with rare top end sessions sprinkled in, which sex-adjusted is probably a similar leap over a similar time frame. She does vary it a bit (eg has 1 rest day per week, sometimes makes the long run a progression, adds/replaces with the elliptical) but the two threshold sessions are the weekly staple. Can't persuade her to do 3 until she stops improving! As an aside, whilst there appears no fast work in sirpoc's training it's probably worth remembering he races 5k every 3 or 4 weeks which is a decent max stimulus. It may not work for everyone but this sort of training certainly works for some. If you're time limited and plateaued there's no harm in giving it a go.

You are totally correct, he was a top cyclist himself, winning many regional races with prize money + almost a bronze medal in national team championship before it appears, finishing 4th. But he stop cycling in 2017, did nothing until 2021 in January, went from a 24-25 5k to an 19 in about 15 months but plateau for a long time training like Daniels latest edition book. Then went back to what he did cycling which they call sweespot and performances rocket again after around 6-8 months of total plateau. I ask question and he's been mostly the same weight throughout, so this is just training gains. Like you said. Maybe once a month does a park run, which is some stimulation. But also a significant amount less by a large percentage of what other guys would do in terms of vo2 or speedwork , as nothing else is really faster than his 10 mile or hour pace, often quite a bit slower.

    "msg": "Here are her last couple of weeks of training that are pretty typical. Whilst not identical to the methods in the thread there is a lot of similarities. Main points of differences are I) that she has a rest day every week and typically does two sessions, instead often adds some intensity to the long run knowing the following day is a rest day. ii) And she adds some extra speed work (typically stride/uphill strides and efforts). On top of this she does strength and/or core 2-3 times per week. Most of her philosophy comes from the SWAP podcast which really emphasises repeatability/consistency/threshold/ strides. M : Rest T: 8x 3 mins uphill @sub-threshold (1 min downhill jog recovery) - nb. we have mountains which makes this possible. PM: 30 mins recovery elliptical W: 1hr z1 road run Th: 1hr Z1 + 5 x hill strides F: 4x2k @MP, 5x400 @cv (1 min). Pm 30 mins recovery elliptical Sat: 1hr Z2 Sun: 1hr 45 trail run - z1 30 mins of Z3 up climbs. M: Rest T: 10x1k @hm (1 min), pm: 30 mins recovery elliptical W: 1hr z1 trail run. Thurs: 1hr z1 road run F: 1h 10 with 5k @ MP, then 10x30s hill efforts to finish, Pm: 30 mins recovery elliptical Sat: 1hr z1 road run Sun: 1hr 45 long run with 7k of sub threshold efforts during it. Every so often she does a session like 10x (800@HM, 200@5k) with 90 s recovery to get a bit of faster work in. Additionally, every few months she does a 4 week base block of slightly volume (eg 60 mpw) of only easy running and strides. Personally I think the difficulty with the triple singles threshold approach is potentially it's simplicity/monotony/relentlessness - this will suit certain personality types better than others. For others you may need to be creative to keep it engaging (playing with the distances of reps, for example threshold pyramid to work a range of paces) or as above moving some of the effort into the long run, or doing one of the sessions as a fartlek on the trails using climbs to do the sub threshold work. The key is finding that balance where it's something you can repeat week after week accruing lots of time in this sub threshold state through the week. For me that's easy running with 2 sub-threshold sessions a week plus a fartlek fun run containing sub threshold sections, plus the odd stride session. Also I need a rest day as I'm injury prone. I'm committed to this till my goal race in December so will be interesting to see how it plays out.",

It's called zone 2 training, not zone 1, and the additional intensity comes at the expense of duration and thus the total time spent utilizing fat near fatmax for the vast majority of people. Either idea is contrary to a multitude of studies on HIIT showing that it can be very effective at improving fat oxidation ability, but if we are talking about changing our training solely because of this, then I think the minimum acceptable proof is at least an observational study where a low-intensity group is compared to a high-intensity group and not a study that is saying there is an inverse correlation between blood lactate and fat oxidation, which wasn't in dispute.

That intensity is typically above 50%VO2max give or take, which is around >60%HRmax for trained athletes. However, i fully agree with Seiler, that duration and intensity is interconnected. On the other side, the practical point is that a lot of hobby athletes train around 1h give or take (easy units). So we often assume that duration for easy running, without writing that down. In a 5 zone model, zone 2 is typically between 60-70%HRmax (for trained athletes=my default assumption). And that is the zone were e.g. i have within 1h, exactly zero increase of my lactate level above lactate baseline level. This is btw also the intensity description of sirpoc, for his 50min easy runs. For me, it is also very save to assume that also sirpoc does not increase his lactate level above his baseline. This range uses very little fast twitch fibers, and so they can recover better. This way he can train again hard on the next day, 48h recovery time for the fast twitch fibers is good and he sets the next training impulse. That easy pace is the fundament here. So at the end of the day an easy unit shall not be seen isolated. As i discussed with sirpoc, a training unit just below 2mmol is not the same effort as a unit in zone 2 (see my above description), for the same duration.

Beyond that the more intense an exercise is, the longer the recovery, and the higher the proportion of type II fibers used- not something being questioned. My take is that easy runs should be as intense as to not impede any other session or defeat their purpose, but that's as far as I will go without hard evidence. Maybe for you and your time schedule, that means training at lactate baseline, but I think we should be weary of any element of cargo cultism and confirmation bias just because a gentleman has found success. It seems a bit ridiculous to measure lactate at the end of an easy 1-hour session to make sure it's under an arbitrary amount when the actual boundary of the moderate-to-heavy domain is unclear and could be above baseline or even above LT1.

I re-read this thread 2 times with the focus on the shared knowledge about - easy runs - cautious addition of mileage Following this guidance finally brings me close to the 50th session, after several failed attempts in the last years to pick up running again (got injured real quick when I tried). I could easily handle a 5k every month, but don't need it to determine my paces: Training results are obvious and I adjust (conservatively) by training results. I ran one 5000m, more a reward than an enlightening about paces. And I am looking forward to a cross-country run and it's atmosphere. Pinning a bib, hooray!

It's really easy for me to then know where I'm at, then adjust my paces without having to buy more lactate strips. I've spot tested this approach now and again to lactate, and for me, I'm confident in its accuracy. 4. It does give me a small amount of \"harder\" work. I have gone about 10 weeks with no racing I think before, or something long like that. My improvement in that period was the same. So how much this helps is totally up for debate. Note, the reverse of point 3 applies here, my training tells me almost certainly when I'm going good and 90% of the time translates into a PB in the 5k. So I guess I'm picking when I run my 5ks, it tends to be when I feel I have stepped it up, which in turn happens to be every 4-5 weeks.

If true and confirmed by research with a larger sample size, this could be quite groundbreaking. The implication is that an improvement in something like lactate threshold or mechanical efficiency is offsetting a lower VO2max, which is also often the first thing to peak in elites so it could be a sign they should focus on more heavy domain intensity vs. polarized. I will add the cavate that this would matter more for half and full marathoners who race below threshold.

I measured lactate after 2nd and 4th rep and I measured 2.9 mmol and 3.8 mmol, and my HR was 161 and 163 bpm. During my 10k PB I had an average HR of 187 bpm. Admittedly, I've done very little threshold-training since I started training seriously back in late April. Most of my intervals have been VO2, so it was expected that my VO2max would be higher than my threshold pace, but being told my LT2 is almost 30 seconds slower per km than my 10k PB makes me a bit confused. Coupled with the fact that I can run with a blood lactate level of >7 mmol for more than 44 minutes is also a bit perplexing.",

I also do quick ramps at the track after I do CP/CV testing to generate a lactate curve. 10 minute stage lengths at various paces. Super easy.
