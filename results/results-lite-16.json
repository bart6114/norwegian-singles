    "msg": "I think one of the reasons this has been such an insightful discussion for many is that this method produces fantastic results in a commonsense way, YET flies in the face of foundational training philosophies. There have been several in disbelief of the results achieved. I think behind their troll appearance may be genuine questions of WHY this works. Like Summary shared, here was a great post around page 60 summarizing what this training methodology IS, and I think it would also be fruitful to summarize what this is NOT and WHY. Below are common training ideas that are challenged in this approach. Note that these comments are for 5k-HM not the Marathon, which is a different beast. Periodization: No up weeks or down weeks. No weeks with shifting focus. No peaking. Just settle into your maximum sustainable training load and repeat. This not only works for hobby joggers from this thread, but also for the elites coach by Grete Koens. Perhaps periodization is an engineered way to handle a training system that inherently tears you down more than it builds you up? Progressive Overload: The workouts do not need to progress for you to progress. There will be a ceiling to this approach, but it will take a surprisingly long time and will take you much higher than other approaches. There is a progression, but it looks more like season over season rather than week over week. Variety: Variety is overrated (and helps coaches keep their jobs). Running is simple. A 5k is 95-99% an aerobic event. Variety works in fields like investing because there is no way to know for certain what will pay off. But in running, we know what trains the aerobic system with little cost: easy running and sub threshold running. In this case, the best investment strategy is going all in what we know works FOR THE LEAST COST. Specificity: This is a big one. Perhaps a good way of looking at this methodology is that the quality of a session is determined by how little recovery time it costs you, rather than how strong the stimulus is in preparing you for the event. Adaptations take a long time, so any stimulus will need to be highly repeatable for it to have any effect. To stimulate the demands of an event there will need to be ample recover, resulting in lower overall training load due to needed recovery time. Better to keep aerobic load high and humming along, and just freshen up as needed before events. Grete Koens does this approach for her elites as well. She says that the 1 specific session before a major event are more to convince the athlete they can perform, rather than any underlying physiology. Training at 5k pace consistently WILL make you more efficient at 5k pace—however, it will cost you. And it’s the cost that matters in the long term (injury/ overall training load). Also, racing fairly frequently helps with performance. Often, a 5k race is less taxing than a 5k specific session! Speed Training: I love strides. I’m surprised that KI and Spiroc don’t do them. But it makes sense, because the likelihood that speed is the limiting factor for hobbyjoggers like me is very low. We are all aerobically undertrained, and no amount of short speed will make up for that. I hope this helps summarize what this training is NOT. I'd love to hear y'alls thoughts!",

Remember , 3 sub threshold workouts seems to be the key to this system in accumulation of as much weekly tss as we can. As sirpoc posted a few pages back, there isn't anything inherently special about what he set out, it will just likely be the best makeup for someone time crunched and looking to maximise load but still recover suitable to just keep repeating.

I found it incredibly interesting of how he found CTL marry up closer to power, no matter what the training makeup. The variation in that seems to exist, but likely small. It would be great if anyone could answer as to why sirpoc and KI don't do strides, other than the answer of \"they just don't do strides\" . Again, this is a huge deviation away from the norm. But, following the two on Strava , they don't ever run very fast in training really and then it has no negative effect on race day. In fact sirpoc has probably the best equivalent times from 5k , 10k, 10 mile and HM all within a couple of months. They are all almost all within a few seconds of each other. Which also shows fantastic pacing if you look at his race splits but also that specificity itself appears to be irrelevant, for a hobby jogger just looking to improve overall in the grand scheme of things.

But when done correctly they are very in line with this underlying philosophy: get the training adaptations at the least cost. I really enjoyed this blog post from a while back showing how strides transformed a very aerobically trained trail runner. Perhaps one of the reasons strides worked for Andrew Skurka, and may not be needed for Spiroc and KI, is the terrain they train in? Skurka coming from a train background was not efficient for fast road running. But KI and Spiroc's training is pretty much all on roads or treadmill (not Spiroc lol), meaning they are may be getting enough practice on flat/fast terrain? Also, we know that there are diminishing returns with everything, so strides are likely more important the shorter the race...But again, there are many coach who feel strongly that top end speed is important even for marathon/ ultras!",

I get it, I’m shocked as well that folks can get such great results off of just a 75 min long run. You said that his HM is not as good as his 5k….barely. Looking at how tightly coupled spiroc’s 5k, 10k, 10mile and HM times are is just astounding. Like thread voyager said earlier, it’s as if specificity (long run in this case for the HM) is irrelevant if you have a great base. Some who follow this method like to put their Sub T into a long run to get better specificity for the HM. But the point is that no one session matters that much, it’s about maximizing total training quality/volume. So the question isn’t should I do a longer long run, it’s how much is that going to cost me and the overall approach? People respond to training differently. Maybe you can do a more taxing long run and bounce back for 3 sub Ts after (doubt it). This training methodology isn’t saying that any type of training is bad. It’s not saying that a long run isn’t valuable. It’s just saying that long term load is the greatest predictor of performance (which some disagree with, that’s fine.) So if you accept that CTL is the main driver, no single session is that important, including the long run. You have a training budget. With a budget, you can’t have it all. That’s why I think it’s important to articulate what this training is NOT, so going in, you know and accept the trade offs.

    "msg": "I just thought I would post up whilst I have a chance today, as there has been a bit of renewed talk here this week and a few questions that have come up. Firstly, would I be quicker if I did X instead of Y? That's difficult to answer, but again I feel that this comes back to to specificity is a very small factor in the bigger picture. If anyone is in the Strava group, Hard2Find has made an absolutely amazing spreadsheet where you can run models and prepare different training weeks and calculate what load it will bring. He is way smarter than me, myself him, jiggy and shirtboy started discussing something like this only a few days ago and its already made and into version 3 or 4. This won't necessarily answer what makes someone quicker, but is probably the best and most powerful planning tool I've seen made specifically for runners, maybe ever. Which brings be onto a second point, about how I don't specifically feel sub threshold is anything magical, just how my experience from cycling shows it gives the best bang for your buck when it comes to CTL. Now, I have been speaking to a number of old friends who I used to communicate training ideas and sharing of data with when cycling recently, talking to them about training makeup and how it matches or indexes to overall CTL and performance. The difference seemed to range from virtually no difference for me (in terms of getting to a certain CTL was all that mattered, no matter how), to most other people over years of data, seeing difference in training makeup to get to a certain CTL and what power output that resulted in. So the spread in all of our data, was from about 0% difference right up to 11%. One of the guys had a lot of data on swimmers he coached and found the same sort of thing. His suggested was that a reasonable training plan (he mentioned a Maglischo as a baseline) would probably sway around 5% up and down based on the worst conceivable way to train you could think of (totally unstructured) to the best bang for your buck on around 5-10 hours, which appeared in most cases to be sub threshold. In case anyone is unclear on what I am saying here, the example might here my FTP might be 300w on a pretty normal looking textbook training schedule, for a CTL of lets say 80. A totally unstructured and just riding/running randomly makeup, might mean I need a bit more CTL, lets say 85, to reach 300w. But it might only take a CTL of maybe a bit less than 80, to reach 300w when doing sub threshold work. Now, one thing it also does appear, as the hours increase and you are less time crunched, the gap looks to probably close a bit and the options you also have of makeup of training, shrinks as well as you will be doing 80%+ or more very easy work, whereas I am sticking by to 75-25%. Why is this the case? who knows, probably all TSS isn't created equal, maybe a traditional training program for any of the aerobic sports has more vo2 work than you need and it tires you out for everything else. Maybe there is another reason. So the big question is, how does looking at top amateur riders and a bunch of swimmers (which I must stress, is not pulled from scientific studies) transfer to running? Well as I have said before, I have seen the same play out in my own running training. Will it be the same for everyone? probably not, but if we had another data long term, I am sure we would see the patterns there. One of the main problems is runners don't seem to collect data about their own training accurately, which is the main issue. Even if they have years worth of data, they aren't updating thresholds, zones (sorry Coggan, I mean levels) so their actual daily TSS and overall CTL lacks accuracy. Could you probably ice the cake better if you want to train for a specific event? Probably. If you absolutely only were going to do 5ks, should you try and find a balance of some sort of 5k pace or vo2 max work? Probably. Is it going to be the limiting factor for a hobby jogger? Probably not. The other good thing about training like this is you can pretty much be in peak shape for a range of events , 5k to HM I am within a few seconds of where I want to be. Right, that's long enough on that, but it's something quite a few people have asked me about lately so thought I would spend some time going through some of where I am at on it. A couple of other of small notes. I've come to the conclusion this is about 5-8.5 hours max here as the sweetspot, to running this sweetspot stuff, excuse the pun, on this singles approach. You could maybe do a touch less, but having thought about it more I don't think you will be getting the benefit . The third session is the key to creating that extra bit of load, week in, week out that all adds up in the end. Anything much less than 5 hours, realistically you are losing the benefit as it just doesn't give you enough hours for 3 sessions and to keep things fresh and sustainable. Two other updates. No I don't run 400s anymore. They didn't create anymore or less lactate and they trash my legs for the next day more (I've dumped them for a while and still improving at the same linear rate in the 5k) and I've upped the rest to 2 mins on the 3200 because in the week in the route I run after work, there's a road I need to cross and it takes more than the 1 minute rest to get over it ha ha so literally no special reason. Same with doing 1600s not 2ks. No actual reason other than that I don't have to cross a road mid run. A bit random, but I saw these questions somewhere in the thread a while back and forgot to answer them! P.S I'm not sure who made me guardian of the thread. There's other guys way smarter than me here. My only skill I think is learning quite quickly what works and what doesn't when it comes to training. If this has all helped anyone over the last 7-8 months, that's awesome. I'm under no illusions myself that I am as good as running as I was cycling, but I am still enjoying it and still improving.

    "msg": "I have been consistently following this method for the past 3 months. I had no races during that period, but 3 months ago I ran 2 half marathons, finishing in 1:22 and 1:23. My personal record (PR) was set 2 years ago at 1:19. After that, I focused on running 2 marathons and encountered a few injuries. Consequently, my speed in the half marathon distance dropped a bit, and I was struggling to return to a sub-1:20 half. I slowly started implementing this training method since about September. I did lactate testing and was surprised right away by how much faster lactate accumulates than I thought, which required me to adjust my paces accordingly. Most of my training was done on a treadmill since the weather has been poor here in the winter, and I work from 8 am to 5 pm, leaving no time for outdoor training during daylight hours. I began with 10x3-minute intervals at about 15.5 km/h, 6x5-minute intervals at 15 km/h and 10x3-minute intervals at 14.5 km/h. I successfully completed every workout and gradually increased my pace by 0.1 km/h each week. Currently, I am running at 16.4, 15.9, and 15.4 km/h. Every third week, I reduced the volume to about 70-80%, akin to a recovery week. Long run 60-90min. Now, my normal weeks consist of approximately 85 km of running, with easier weeks around 60 km. Additionally, I incorporate Zwift bike rides—easy lower zone 2 training—about 3-6 times a week, lasting 40-60 minutes, as I recover without any issues in time. On easy days when I feel fresh, I also added 6 short strides on the treadmill, lasting about 15-30 seconds, to work on a bit of top-end speed at 18 km/h with a 9% incline. I've been using a Sole treadmill for workouts, and it seems to me that all the paces I've been running are significantly faster. For instance, the 10-minute intervals I run on the treadmill at 15.4 km/h translate to easily running sub-3:40 per km outside. On my recovery days, I run at about 130 bpm. In November, that pace was about 5:05 to 5:15 per km, and now it's about 4:30 per km. I've tried following many plans before with mixed results, and this approach is the easiest to follow, and I recover much faster than ever before and feel much stronger. Anyway, it seems to me like I could run a about 1:17 half marathon right now, and I have a race coming up this Sunday. I will report on the result.",

Maybe 5k time to line it up with would make sense? But the big one would be from what sirpoc posted, that I found incredibly interesting. Is the difference in performance in running also around 10% between the best and worst training you could possibly conceive, for the same training makeup. This is going to be very hard to answer, if you are smart enough to track CTL, you probably aren't dumb enough to do a really bad training block just for our own experiments. This I think would answer many of the big questions a lot of us have always wondered. Maybe having an outsider coming and looking in has helped. I myself have been locked into obsession over Daniels plans for far too long that I never even really considered there might be better way to train.

The people getting excited about this method are recreational athletes with: This methods makes very effective use of available training time, addressing the core limiting factor of performance for most recreational athletes (fundamental aerobic ability/steady state running/whatever you want to call it). It minimizes/eliminates the higher injury risk training types that aren't hugely relevant to most recreational athletes -things like high mechanical load of really fast running, high metabolic loads of really hard intervals, overexposure of fatigue from monster long runs. It's really simple and easy to follow, ensuring that the correct things get consistently done. A program from Daniels running formula (or similar books) tends to be prescriptive in a way that takes away common sense in the daily execution of training in my observations of athletes -so the practical reality of the training is often much worse than the hypothetical value of whats in the book.

Anything really that is simple and repeatable to 1) establish and consistently maintain an accurate FTP value and 2) for evaluating the correlation between CTL, training intensity distribution, and performance. Everyone could train to their preference, as long as they're logging their training accurately and performing the test with the agreed upon frequency. No forced regimens, if you miss a few days or weeks, CTL should capture that and reflect it in your next test. So, there's no pressure to be a workout warrior nor train flawlessly. The variation in approaches and abilities would actually be an asset in this case. Then, at the end of it, everyone can data dump on those of us with the skillset and desire to assemble, clean, analyze, and report on the groups undertaking.

Easy days are Monday, Wednesday and Friday, but each 2 weeks I skip the run on Monday to completely reset and feel fresh for next Threshold interval. On Wednesday and Friday I usually do strides at the end of the run 6 short ones 15-30sec. Sunday as a long run is 75-90min, running just a little faster than easy runs. I did about 200 lactate tests earlier this year, wasted first 50, just to get a feeling on how the lactate behaves. Most of the test were done on with the intervals I still do. But last 2 months I did not do any lactate testing. I don't think it is necessary at all to implement this method. Just be honest with your self and especially when starting, be safe with the pace to not get over the threshold. Like Marius Bakken wrote, if you go over the threshold by 10%(Probably LT2), you get 4-5x more fatigue than staying 10% under it. That's the whole point of this method. I think the paces I hold in intervals can be summed up as the 3min intervals at a bit faster than half marathon pace(around 5 sec per km), 6min intervals at half marathon pace and 10min intervals at pace a bit slower than half marathon pace(5-10sec). But you have to be honest with those paces, and not take the PR that was set on optimal conditions 2 years ago. If you don't feel fresh and struggle to hit all workouts, you are going 2 fast. If someone is doing about 60-80km of training, I am pretty sure they can pretty much jump right in and try this. Maybe start a bit safer by cutting a few intervals on first few weeks. I was injured around hip area for 1 year, so my stride was compromised a bit over the past year. I think my running technique was pretty bad and I was not utilizing muscles in top parts of the leg at all. I think I fixed that by adding in Zwift rides, about 3-5 hours total every week. I think a bit of cross training has huge benefit and can increase load which would injure you if it was done with pure running. Right now I am tapering for the race on Sunday",

I wouldn’t want to exclude anyone interested based on that prerequisite. Also, I don't know why I'm talking like I'm in charge of this haha. It would certainly require a concerted group effort. I think the main motivator behind this group idea would be to see how consistent CTL is in establishing a personal relationship between the level achieved and performance, as well as does it matter how you reach that CTL level (i.e. your intensity distribution) and at what point does a positive linear relationship, assuming it exists, potentially uncouple. Either way, this has the makings of a fine science fair project, pulled off by the most unlikely group of randos ever haha P.S. Regarding the lactate and VO2Max, I’ve not seen a specific equation from Olbrecht on a large generalized scale. Was that maybe in the paper he published on the 900 swimmers he tested? Regardless, yes, since both are a function of speed, having the two equations (preferably on a large sample scale) allows you to express VO2 as a function of lactate (or visa versa).

    "msg": "I have digested the lactate management/science for about a year and then this found this thread and it pushed me over the top to try it. Before this I was doing lots of easy volume. I am trying doing this with zero tracking of pace, HR, lactate, distance, no Strava or anything. I only track my weight and race times and dictate a short account of each run to Apple Notes. I use all my bodies internal sensors and try to stay in the right range entirely based on the Borg scale and talk test and just my own judgment and discipline. I live in Colorado and run in the mountains a lot and flat, and all kinds in between. I follow a 5 day cycle an so I don’t associate running with monotony of week and because there are 5 fingers on my hand and I keep track that way. I run every day for joy and nature time mostly. Day 1 - Easy, 40-60 mins Day 2 - Sub threshold light, \"ballet\" day (I love ballet), I work on a very light cadence, listen to no music and push into zone 2+ to very light zone 3. Recover once in a while via jogging. Afternoon upper body strength of pull-ups, pushups dips, etc.. Day 3 - Long run in mountains, or not, just trying to get through the distance as slowly as possible. Day 4 - Easy day, 1hr-ish, afternoon strength Day 5 - Sub threshold intervals of a few minutes long to upbeat music punctuated by walks to some landmark for about a minute. I work on great form and staying strictly below anything hard. About 10k. Planning to run a lot of 5ks and the Bolder Boulder 10k and see how I will do. I am pretty slow but want to break 20 in the 5k. 47 years old, lost 34 pounds last year via calorie counting (now I eat intuitively too). After several cycles of this I feel amazing.",

    "msg": "I really like your philosophy, specifically the no tech tracking. I stopped wearing my Garmin in favor of a simple analog watch after a stress fracture and have been loving the simplicity. It helps me to focus in on my pace and really dial in with my body, which is especially important for the subT workouts. I do use time, but I have to calculate my paces before I start my workout, which also helps to be disciplined. I did a 8x1k workout last week, and only looking at time at the end, my first 4 reps were 4:14,4:13,4:14,4:14.",

    "msg": "Having a hell of a time with the blood lactate testing. Im in the US, got myself a lactate plus, and have been trying for 3 sessions to get reasonable data with no luck. Ive got the procedure down, but essentially my readings are too low, I think. I clean my finger with an alcohol wipe, dry with clean napkin, lance, wipe away first droplet with clean napkin again, take sample... Getting nice looking droplets and no failed readings anymore, but they still seem off. I ran a 6x1M session yesterday, starting a bit slower then my estimated HM pace, taking 2 measurements after every 2 reps (60s rest between reps, longer rest to get measurements (about 1.5-2 minutes). 7:15 per mile for first 2 reps -1.8mmol.L. 7:05 per mile next 2 reps, still 1.6-1.8mmol. Great, Im fitter than I suspected (so I thought) 6:50 per mile for 2 - Again, 1.8mmol/L. Ok, something is off. HR was way above threshold here. Took another readings on other hand, 4.0mmol... very frustrating. I thought once contaminated with sweat, you would end up with high readings. I am not sure what I am doing wrong to see lower than expected readings, or a difference hand to hand. So anyway, Ive ordered new lancets directly from the manufacturer, and their calibration fluid. Im quite sure I overran that workout yesterday though, feeling pretty gassed today. Maybe ill move to sampling at the quad.",

As the name suggests, this file will model your lactate test results, along with HR data from the test if you include that. You can also select lactate values and return the associated pace and heart rate from the curve.",
