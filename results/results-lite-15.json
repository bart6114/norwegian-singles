    "msg": "I fear I may have discovered this thread too late! I too have been training with a modified version of Norwegian training. Not quite the same as Sirpoc’s, but similar enough. I too have been running PRs at an age where I would not have expected that such things would be possible (age 46). I’m not as fast in the 5k as I was many moons ago as a DIII college runner, but I’m close. And for distances over 8k, I’m better than I ever was. Some comments and thoughts that perhaps add something to this very long thread. -As background, I live at nearly 8000 ft. of elevation. I was more of a speed guy back in the day (4:07-1500) who was relatively weak in longer distances (16:07 5k, 27:28 8k) (dare I say, \"fast twitch\"). I can still run a 27-second 200 at 46. I used to be able to run a 52-second split on a 4x4. -My marathon PR is 2:59, which I ran while training for the Leadville 100 (which I finished in 23 hours) with just jogging the mountains as training. I suspect I can knock 10 minutes off that if I dedicate myself to it, but just haven’t had time or motivation to do so. I just ran my first sub hour 10 mile three days ago. I ran my first sub 36 10k four days before that. I’m at low elevations while visiting the inlaws, so clustering in some time trials. Never did an interval longer than 6:15 in training. My quads are thrashed from back-to-back long time trials, so not sure I’d recommend that! -I train with a HRM and test lactate after most of my workouts. -I typically do 2-3 threshold sessions a week. I sometimes do a Bakken-style “x” element workout when I’m training for something shorter than 5k. I aim for 20-25% of my volume in thresholds. I do my easy days sub 70% of max HR, which ain’t easy at 8000 feet when nothing is flat. Plenty of hills in my neighborhood force my pace to slower than 10’ a mile. Sometimes I’m sub-7 sub 120 HR on the downs. -I occasionally do a 20 x 300 off 1’ (jogging the remaining 100 of the 400) at 5k pace. As long as I stick to current (not goal) 5k pace, I find that my lactate stays below 3.5 mmol/l on those sessions. If I do these in 62.x, I’ll be around 3 mmol/l. That’s low 17s for 5k at 7000’. For folks that want to pursue this training, this is similar to the 20 x 400 session that the Ingebrigtens (occasionally) do (Bakken wrote about it in the article published previously on this thread), except it takes me the same amount of time to do a 300 as it takes them to do a 400! -I find that 20 x 200 at current mile pace (not goal mile pace) with a 200 super easy jog ends with my lactate around 3.5. Just putting that out there. -I have not found the heart rate correlation to be quite as linear as others. Sometimes I can get my HR up to 170 and keep my lactate below 3.0. Other times that sends me up above threshold. I find, with a few exceptions, if I stay below 168, I’m safely below 3.5, but at the threshold, the results vary wildly (I appreciate that last sentence might seem inconsistent with the ethos of this thread, but I play around with things for the sake of experimentation). -For some reason, my lactate tends to go above 3.0 at 168 at low altitude and closer to 170 at 7000 and 8000 ft. No clue why. -On a couple of occasions, I found out I was about to get sick through my lactate meter. On sessions when I felt fine and I kept my HR below the typical thresholds, my lactate was through the roof, totally unexpectedly (8-plus). One time I got bronchitis the next day. The other, a 24-hour flu. -I find that a bad night’s sleep can also send the lactate through the roof. I check my body battery whenever I’m doing a thresh sesh and make sure it’s not atypically low. If it is, I drop the volume by 20% and HR by 5 beats a minute, and that usually works out ok for me. For me, the lactate meter is much more sensitive to life stress than HRM. -I’m also a volunteer track coach, and I apply a version of these principals to the athletes I coach. Mostly high school kids, but I coach a couple of national-class masters athletes as well. -I keep the X element for kids I coach, because three sessions of threshold is hard for most of them mentally, and I think it matters for distances under 5k. -This training is not effective for the 800, in case anyone might have any illusions about that. It’s fine for athletes that are new to the sport that just need to strength to run two good laps, but for boys near 2 and girls near 2:20, this methodology is not effective by itself, though sometimes I do half a threshold session with some added intensity at the end, and that has been fairly effective as a hybrid workout. -For anyone training for the mile to the half marathon, I think this training is markedly superior to Daniels-style training, or Vo2 max training. After I ran ultras, I spent my late 30s doing countless iterations of intense-style training. Kept getting injured and barely got better. -I’m on a 320-day running streak now. Most days I run at least an hour a day. Never felt better.",

Enter this value as LTHR in your Garmin. - Total the recovery time suggested by Garmin for each workout of the week as total recovery time per week in h. - Do 2 or 3 sub-threshold workouts per week, 3 or 4 easy runs. Easy runs of 55-65 min each. One easy run longer. Dial the pace of your easy runs AND the volume of the sub-threshold work to yield a total recovery time per week of 168 h. - As you get fitter, you can increase your pace of the easy runs and/or the volume of sub-threshold runs. But stick to the 168h and aim for as much fast volume as possible (however not exceeding 25% of total mileage) with easy runs @70% HRmax. Have fun!",

My current thought is that if I were to do this, I would do two thresholds and a long run tempo most weeks. Or maybe my alternate training as espoused by this thread with that schedule every other week. Almost every top-notch marathoner I’ve ever read about, including Shorter, Rodgers, Kipchoge, Kiptum, etc.—all do/did longer, continuous tempo efforts. Bakken says long continuous efforts are needed for good marathons. I was thinking about dialing in 2-hour to runs to finish with lactate at 2.5 mmol. Though I have no idea how I would do that at this stage or what paces would get me there. I think Sirpoc has argued in favor three thresholds and an easy two-hour run for marathon training. Does anyone have any evidence, however anecdotal, that the latter approach would be superior to the former? I know that Hard2Find laid out his approach earlier, so I’ve seen that. My hypothesis is that some sustained quality efforts are needed to run a marathon to one’s full potential. But I’m no expert, and I’m open to contrary evidence, if people think it’s out there.

Well, better trained runners are indeed producing such little lactate at that pace the difference between LT1 (~150 minute race pace) and LT2 (~60 minute race pace) is minimal. Thus, squeezing their LT1 down very close to their LT2. Canova would put it as, you don't want to be in peak 10km shape if you're planning to run your best marathon because you'd be producing too much lactate at marathon pace to be metabolically optimized.

If you’re testing yourself, which I believe you said you do, you could perform your own lactate step test and approximate both LT1 and LT2. Some would say that LT1 is an actual metabolic threshold, whereas LT2 is arbitrary. Lexel would probably make this point, since there is an actual “bioenergetic shift” occurring at LT1.

You could certainly just stick to easy/moderate paced long runs, every other week and be fine. You could also implement long runs with tempo pace mixed in. You could do 1-2 long tempos in the 12-15 mile range in addition to your normal easy long runs. The choice is really yours and what you want to put into it. If sub 2:50 is the goal, depending on how fast you are at the shorter distances (I’d use a 10km as the basis), will influence how close to your “marathon potential” you have to be in order to achieve it. Meaning, if you can run sub 36 10km, you don’t need to be as nearly “marathon fit” as if you run 36:40 for 10km, to break 2:50.

There would be many observations above 5, and some likely above 7 and 8, sometimes even above 10, because when the onset of rapid blood lactate accumulate occurs, it comes on fast. And if you're riding THAT line, it's very easy to go over. That's why the Norwegian method stresses staying 5% under that line.

Critical Speed is considered the maximal metabolic steady state. So while blood lactate can rise higher than MLSS, your oxygen consumption will stabilize along with some other bio-markers like phosphocreatine (facilitates muscle contraction) and inorganic phosphate (identifies muscle fatigue). This stabilization won't happen at a speed faster than CS. This suggests that you can run at a faster speed than MLSS before you reach a “true” metabolic steady state. The difference in pace can be relatively marginal and I don’t think the training paces that are then implemented yield any noticeable difference in performance, but that’s the general distinction though.

I did something simple - I started with Jakob's 'old' training : Easy 10k twice daily Subthreshold 5 x 2k (same as 6 mins for Jakob) twice daily Easy 10k twice daily Sub threshold 10 x 1k twice daily Easy 10k twice daily Sub threshold 25 x 400m twice daily And for hobbyjoggers we agreed on one session a day. I have been running 50 years now so I just basically chopped everything in half - instead of 2k/1k/400m I do 1k/500m/200m. I used the tinman calculator to choose the slowest thresh times for my current fitness and I dont think for someone like me the easy days have to be running days - so I just walk. I also have a unique situation that there is no flat ground near my house - I live in a bowl and everywhere is up to start. And finally most of the year like now with the snow - there is only ONE road I can train on So I just came up with the same 10k workout for EVERY SubThresh day : 10 x 200m 5 pct grade up 12 x 500m 2 pct grade up and down 2x1k 5 pct grade back down 60 secs of rest between each run Doing the short little hops (200m) on the way up in the beginning and saving the long runs (1k) for the way back down works great. I also dont do long runs since my main focus is 800m and injury prevention. And since EVERY day is a hill day I dont need to do any xtra sessions of those either. For the uphills I add a few seconds to the tinman times and for the downhills I subtract a few seconds - usually about 5 seconds per 200m seems to work good for the grades I am on. And finally I am retired and try to exercise outdoors every day so a 6 day schedule works a lot better for me. I used to take days off but I found that they just made me feel worse so I go every day now unless I get hurt or is some kind of emergency. So its basically : Day 1 : Walk an hour or so (about 7k) Day 2 : Thresh session : 600m warmup / 10x200m / 12x500m / 2x1k / 600m cooldown wash rinse repeat every 2 days To ease into this I am starting with 4x500m (instead of 12x500m) for a total of 6k a session and plan on adding a couple of 500m runs each month until I hit the same 10k total as the Ingebrigtsens about 4 or 5 months from now - at the same time dropping my thresh times as my fitness levels improve. Its working quite well. The biggest problem I have is forcing myself to run that slow - taking a while to get myself to SLOW DOWN. And second thing that has really shocked and pleased me is how much easier this feels than running this entire road in one stretch with no breaks - which is pretty much what my 'training' has been for years now. Running SubThresh with the 60 seconds rests basically takes almost all the pain out of running. Those 60 sec rests are like respawning in a video game to me and I feel really good at night after any of those thresh sessions are done. And yes its boring but I dont mind that - I think all the Ingebrigtsen training is going to be boring no matter what u do - and in any case every day here is different - on that road last summer I ran into 2 bears and a cougar in just 6 weeks. So that keeps me awake LOL I turn 65 a year from now and my goal is to be in the top 10 USA for 800m. I havent done a race in decades but I did an 800m time trial with my 17 year old son on the track and that time put me at 50th for age group 60-64 so I think this new training could get me there if I can stick it out for the next year or so.",

I was stuck around 39 for a long, long time. Maybe around 4-5 years. That was variation between different plans, coaches etc. In fact I probably have spent more on coaching and books than everyone in this thread combined! Not that I mind , I love my hobby. I started off almost in real time of page 1 of this thread. I read a lot of LRC and thought why not, I seem to run around 39-40 no matter what. I just love 10ks. No idea why. Sucker for pain maybe. They hurt. Anyway, I have stuck pretty much to sirpoc rules. No lactate meter. Just the paces. The only thing I have changed is when Hard2find came along I switched to his document he provided with those paces. It sounded like himself, sirpoc and a few others perhaps worked on this anyway, from reading between the lines and posts here. Yes I have read everything! Not a lot happened. For at least 5-6 weeks. Then suddenly I noticed the 3x3ks I had been doing, suddenly got quite a bit faster. Then the same just kept happening, every second or third week. That was about it was as simple as that. Now I was very curious about as to how this on earth was possible. I am pretty much doing the same amount of hours , 6-7, as I was before. Here is where reading the thread helped. A lot. Well reading it a second time. I plugged all my data into the recommended intervals icu from the past to check past training loads. My CTL or fitness, and this is why you should read the thread, has increased and kept increasing in this time. The overall load of training this way with regards to the way previous coaches had me running, by the metrics, is quite a bit more. This is covered quite a bit somewhere in the middle pages. This is why I think a podcast that has been mentioned would be a great idea, to really summarise it. Anyway, there seems to be a clear relation between increasing of load and then overall performance. I think it's as simple as that. The key is you are doing more, probably aerobically, but the way it is managed, is less taxing on the body. So you are effectively increasing your services capacity, which, at hobby jogger level for the majority of people will lead to better performance. The crazy thing is it feels like you are doing less. I will say, I follow sirpoc on Strava like others. This dude is a machine. The will power he must have to run the same stuff, day in, day out is remarkable. Seeing it myself is really all that keeps me going, as I can see you will improve. But it really, really is not fun. But the feeling I got from such a huge PB made it all worthwhile. I would rather have that in my pocket than feel like a workout hero like before, then be disappointing on race day. Anyway, I hope maybe that provides some insight. I am no expert! But I am a massive fan of the thread and absolutely thrilled I found it and it has totally, totally changed the way I think about running . It has been hard to adjust. I didn't even own a smart watch until 2 years ago, so I am very much of the old skool!!",

I ran in the mid-3:50s and low 15 minute range for 1500/5000 using the easy interval method a couple of years ago, but after that initial success I started to stagnate pretty badly and haven't improved on those times at all in the last two years despite training just as hard and switching back to a more traditional approach for the last 6-8 months or so. I just can't seem to get past that plateau. Others in this thread have compared this approach to the EIM but I feel where the EIM falls short is in the lack of recovery days. Doing 6x1k, 10x400, etc day after day, week after week, wears you down but also in my view does not provide an adequate stimulus due to the long recoveries between intervals. This approach, in contrast, provides more stimulus per workout while still being repeatable AND providing adequate recovery. I'm in my 30s and self-coached so I don't really have anything to lose by giving this a shot. Since I am familiar with the concept through EIM of running intervals slower than what you could handle on the day I think the transition should be pretty seamless. On paces, I will err on the easier/slower side to start as I do come from a middle distance background and in the one half marathon I attempted over the last couple years I blew up horribly at 8 miles and DNFed so I suspect my threshold is pretty weak compared to what you'd expect from my middle distance times. If I feel this approach is worthwhile, I may spring for a lactate meter at some point but to start given my middle distance background I will use the paces that sirpoc provided but will use the predicted pace for the distance one higher (i.e., for \"HM pace\", I will use \"M pace\", for \"CV\" I will use \"HM\", and so on) until I feel I've adapted to the program.",

I've learned about CTL from this thread. I personally, think it is a bit vague, but I will say with this method which is repeatable, you can definitely very clearly see a link between increasing your load and getting faster. With the EIM I simply think there wasn't enough in the actual sessions and probably too many of them spread out. I think the 3rd session a week personally is the difference maker in terms of load but also creating a huge aerobic engine in the 3x a week sub threshold appraoch. You only have to see sirpoc results in this thread. He is on the absolute shortest side you can get of a long run but is still in absolute control right up to HM. That is the biggest thing I have taken away from this I guess a long with absolutely no longer worrying about speed work. All the speed sessions in the world won't make you faster if you don't have that aerobic engine. That comes with pushing your threshold up from below. I would highly recommend you join the Strava group. Follow KI but also sirpoc84. He is very good as responding on there as this thread calms down a bit. There's good activity in the group.

If solo, I’ve done a consistent but not taxing pace (7:15-7:40) for the first part of the run before a 4-5 mile continuous, progressively faster segment at faster than MP (6:20-6:40). The pace is below HMP or what I would do in a long threshold. Cooldown of 1-3 miles done at moderate pace. Running with a group, often less flexibility but I’d prefer to run a slightly faster tempo overall 7:10-7:25) with a faster finish than start if possible (6:45-7:05). I think these runs end up being a little different and more specific to the marathon than the Norwegian method of course. From my experience, outside of getting the valuable time on feet and practice for fueling/marathon distance etc., they build a nice comfort running at MP (for raceday) though rarely dialing into the exact effort/pace. Id say my training might be best suited for 5K-HM but my last marathon I felt extremely comfortable in despite bad conditions. I am not all-in on a time in my marathon running really though maybe that changes for Boston. And getting ready for the mile only requires a few specific workouts (hills/speed), and honestly some prep races can do the trick as well. Nordas has said that and I agree. So to the poster directly above I’d say hills (I do 12x200 w/ jog down rest), a speed workout or two (4-3-2 sets, good rest) and some prep races. For the mile/3k I think you’d be all set. I ran under 4:50 at 5th Ave on a short buildup with that. We’ll see if with a real summer I can go sub-4;40 and perhaps sub-17. The 800 is a different matter for me requiring a little more specificity.",

    "msg": "Does anyone know if a podcast came out of this in the end? I figured it would have been posted but just checking in case I missed it. Big fan of the thread, will add to the number who would love this in an audio format. It's simple yet really complicated, almost like a paradox. I guess it can be as basic as you want or really dive deep into what sirpoc has also gone into and put that icing on cake, with really making sure you get every percentage you can. Someone mentioned conversations about running? That seems like a great idea. I loved those guys previous Norwegian episodes and in my eyes this is more relevant probably to the majority of their listeners who are not pros and also way slower than sirpoc. I know I would listen to it anyway 😊. Just a thought as an onlooker. Could even be someone listens to another pod they think this would fit in with and send as a listener suggestion? At the end of the day, on the podcast circuit we seem to get a lot of the same stuff over and over this would be really new and fresh.",
