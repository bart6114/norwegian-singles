Whereas, if you used a slightly longer duration range, say 2-25 minutes, you would have a coinciding CS and MLSS and a VO2 steady state but it would not be a maximal VO2 steady state and to the proponents of the CP/CS concept, that feature takes precedence in “optimizing” the test duration range?",

One additional editorial comment: you can now find numerous studies in the literature comparing various \"thresholds\" (including FTP), some finding a difference on average, others not, all depending on how the measurements are made, possibly the population, etc. Even when people don't find any difference on average, though, they somehow feel compelled to comment on how any two such approaches aren't \"equivalent\" or \"interchangeable\", because they don't give the exact same result in every individual. To me, this is missing the point entirely - why would you expect different ways of maximal metabolic steady state to always exactly agree in the first place (especially given biological variability/technological error)? Furthermore, why does it even matter in the first place? Agreement or lack thereof really says nothing about the underlying physiology, which is far more interesting and important. As I tell my students, ask good questions, attack with rigor. IMO, comparing CP vs. MLSS vs VT vs. NIRS vs. iEMG vs. epinephrine vs. what have you fails the first test, hands down.

How they call the ‘zones’, I do not care, that is quite irrelevant. The name ‘Severe’ looks like a marketing name to me, like Tinman. The standard definition of MLSS, I call it now MLSS (trad) can be adopted, as it is arbitrary. Again the parameters 10min, 30min and 1mmol (@ unbelieve) are random numbers and they have no special physiological meaning. Someone could say use 1.5mmol, or 2mmol, or 1.25mmol, or 15min to 30min, or 20min to 40min, or whatever you get the idea. It’s all arbitrary. Also lactate levels cannot be transferred from athlete to athlete. It’s not difficult to realize that this MLSS definition is a severe problem (haha). Neither CP nor MLSS needs to be dropped. Scientists can even keep up the MLSS (trad). MLSS (trad) is then typically 7-9% lower as CV, FTP about 5% lower -> theory and practice. And now i drop the bomb, the link between your Coggan power zones and CP: Level 4: Lactate Threshold: 91-105% FTP; Level 5: VO2max 106-120% FTP And exactly around 105-106% FTP is CP, which is exatcly the boarder between your level 4 and 5.

However, what is the value of identifying this rather obscure point? Contrary to Jones's assertions, it is clearly above the point at which metabolic control is lost.

    "msg": "Likely, without easy running to buffer up the sub-T workouts, it becomes harder to improve since you lose a big element of gaining aerobic ability. You might end up detraining a little before hitting some 3 sub-T workout equilibrium. But the 25-30% volume being sub-T rule is just a rule to allow for even distribution of volume as you add more and more past your baseline. Basically, if you plan on adding significant volume, it can't all be sub-T or you'll burn out, but it shouldn't all be easy since then you're missing out on some gains. 25-30% sub-T adding is the sweet spot. But if your volume comes from sub-T already, there's no problem if you're resting instead of doing easy runs, except that it's less aerobic management training. But like I said above, do account for a little bit of detraining only running 3 times a day compared to more full weeks. So it might mean your sub-T workouts get slower for a while before settling. Definitely don't try to stick to same sub-T paces as when you're running a lot more because as your fitness falls a bit it might not be sub-T anymore and then all that injury risk yada yada grows bigger.",

I know that sometimes that can be a sign of excessive fatigue and in the past I have had that happen. This is a different type, I feel stronger than 4 weeks ago. I don't want to assign that to the training alone, I am using this method as I rebuild from a few subpar years and one year of almost no running due to achilles surgery. So it could just be fitness returning as well. But I do think for me there is value in doing this with conservative pacing. Week 3 I ran 58.5 miles. I did SubT workouts on Tues, Thurs and Saturday (4 x 10min at 6:54, 5 x 8min at 6:49 and 10x4min at 6:35). Sunday I ran my usual trail look for 13.2 miles and came to the conclusion that for a guy pushing 47, running a longish run the day after quality isn't really feasible anymore. So I pared back to 2 SubT workouts but lengthened them a bit. Week 4 had SubT workouts on Tuesday and Friday (4x10min at 6:35 and 5x10min at 6:54). Sunday had a long run of 14.2 miles with about 1400 feet of elevation gain. 60 miles for the week. I need to do some sort of race or time trial to see how I'm progressing. I also signed up for a half marathon on March 2. Low expectations, lifetime best of 1:17 in 2011 at age 33. Really just hoping to be around lower than 1:30 and expect a bit higher than 1:25.",

His performances in his 40s speak for themselves and testiment to this system. There are dozens of testimonies in this thread of people who have improved more or less copying him. Hundreds on Strava. A guy posted in fantastic detail the other day on Reddit how he went from almost 7 years as a stagnated 20 min guy well into his 40s to breaking 18 after 9 months of this and still improving, even down to the Mile. Question is, why wouldn't anyone consider training like this? Not even should they. Also, no disrespect to Kristoffer, but sirpoc is at another level to him. Sure, he has Henrik coaching him.

I'm now 50 and anyone who has been here a while will likely be as beat up by the place, skeptical and probably down right miserable by a lot of the experience. I don't believe in miracle cures. I don't believe in miracle training. In fact, quite frankly I had this thread down as a bunch of idiots fumbling around in the dark. But hey, don't judge me that's how LR makes you feel! But then, you actually take a step back and think 'Hmmm, there is a lot of actual positivity here' So, my background, I ran in school. I was average. Very average. Gave up, came back as a married, hobby guy at 36. I ran 19:11 for the 5k and a 1:28 half at 38. I stumbled around that level for a while, mainly using a mixture on and off of various new ideas coming out, or simply going back to more traditional methods from various cookie cutter plans you will find in the usual literature. I actually scraped an 18:56 at 41 from a day where it all came together. Anyway, come around this time last year, this thread I guess was in its peak. I seemed to tick all the boxes. My best was long behind me, I was running around 6 hours a week still with various plans but I was going nowhere. Was running around 21:30. Tbh, I was pretty happy with that at nearly 50. But decided, why the hell not try this new craze. Wow, did I make the right decision! I read most of this thread through twice. To make sure I hadn't missed or messed up any of the interpretation. Set out to just start out right away: My initial impressions were I must be missing something, at the end of my first week it felt way too easy. Almost like a recovery week from what I was used to. The workouts felt like I could have easily done more reps although I did start cautious and that's not a feeling I have had in my previous years very often! I was already doing 6 hours so I basically just replicated the classic here, 3*10, 6*5 and 10*3. And I just went on .....and on.....and on. Suddenly week 9 I noticed things were significantly faster. I jumped in a 5k , ran 20:50. Just kept going. 3 easy runs and the long run plus the same workouts. On and on and on. Boring. Very boring. I hopped in another 5k around week 16. 20:21. You see the pattern. On and on and on. Week 21. Ran 20 flat. You know the pattern, same week in week out. This was by far the fastest I had run in a very long time. Anyway, I was building to a half, this was around week 28. I ran 19:32 in a random 5k I jumped in , them the week after I broke 1:30 with a 1:29 flat in a HM. As time as gone on, I kept improving, when, remarkably just before Christmas I broke my best from when I was 41, a couple of days after my 50th birthday . I ran 18:29 and was blown away by it. To have a sense of achievement at this age just blows my mind. The key to this is the consistency. It has allowed me to just keep going, doing my own thing. Whilst fellow old friends of mine are training themselves into a black hole of fatigue, I am staring into said black hole but never faling in. Anyway, last Sunday I broke 1:25 and ran 1:23:55 in a half. Cleaning up on my new age category of 50+ afterwards much to my delight! I have managed to increase load as that time has gone on. From hovering around 6 hours to managing sometimes to squeeze out around 7. Running everyday I can, as suggested. Paces from the original posts way back now, seem pretty good. Maybe I had to slow them a bit for the first month or so, but quite quickly I feel into the Goldilocks zone sirpoc84 suggests. Easy runs are easy, just cap at 70% HR and whatever will be will be. Probably the most difficult aspect of this is working out a balance between how much you have improved, versus where to go next in terms of paces, more time training to squeeze some more load out. It seems madness to me now I was doing 200-400 repeats to give me a speed boost in a 5k. I mean really. I was a 21 min guy. This is simply madness when you think of it. Absolutely the limiting factor is my aerobic engine was running out of fuel wah before any speed I had in my legs was usual. I just wanted to share this and hope it might inspire someone else to never give up on improving based on this thread. I thank those who posted their own experiences here that helped me decide to dive head first in myself. Highly recommend the Strava group by the way, all the main characters of the thread post there regularly and as others have said, it's not behind any paywall which I find remarkable.

I'm fast twitch so perhaps lacking aerobically. My legs feel trashed the next day after these workouts. No way I could tolerate 3 workouts a week. If you do a long run & 3 workouts a week that only gives you 1 easy day between. Plus a workout day & long run likely fall back to back. In my opinion, that's intense for a has been hobby jogger like me. I used the Norwegian Singles Calculator using my most recent 5k time of 18:39 (course was accurate). Also used the suggested pace times below to compare. I run 45 miles a week, so am allowed 4 miles of sub threshold work, but haven't been able to tolerate near that much. Easy runs are around 8:30 pace, (which isn't fun at all going that slow, except for days after workouts where I'd rather not be running at all because again my legs are dead). Track's snow covered & it's nothing but hills here so it's hard to find a somewhat flat stretch to do these workouts. (more excuses, I know) Subthreshold workout recommendations: 1K reps (usually 8-12 x 1K) with 60\" rest at 10mi to 15K pace (For me that'd be 7 @6:23 mile pace) 2K reps (usually 4-6 x 2K) with 60\" rest at HM pace (for me 3 @6:32 mile) 3k reps (usually 3 x 3K) with 60\" rest at 30K pace (for me that’d be 2 @6:43) What effort are people rating these workouts? I'd probably rate these 8.5-9/10 whereas other training plans I'd rate workouts 7/10. I'm not getting a lot of cardiac drift so perhaps they're still in the sub threshold HR category. I've sorta been following the Tinman method where a rough guideline is CV workout of 5x1k at 6:20 pace, 60 sec jog recover, plus 5 x 200 meter at 1600m pace with 200 jog. Other workout is 3 mile tempo at 5k+ 60 sec, so 7 min pace. This method feels way easier than the above workouts, which makes me wonder if I'm doing it all wrong.",
