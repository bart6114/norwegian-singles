    "msg": "Not that you asked, but‚Ä¶If I were going to explain it‚Ä¶and keep it VERY simple: Slow Twitch = Type 1 Fast Twitch = Type 2a and Type 2x Lactate generated by the fibers increases as you move from slow twitch to fast twitch. The faster you run, the more energy you derive from glucose (there‚Äôs an inverse linear relationship between fat utilization and carbohydrate utilization as exercise intensity increases). Fast twitch fibers require more glucose and thus, produce more lactate. The fibers have different ‚Äúlactate transport‚Äù qualities as well. Slow twitch fibers will use the lactate to convert to energy. So while the fast twitch fibers are producing more lactate, the slow twitch fibers are absorbing it, in very simple terms. By doing consistent endurance training over time, the Type 2a fibers will take on more of the characteristics of the Type 1 fibers, so they can further aid in the lactate absorption/conversion process. Paces in the range of easy to tempo, roughly, are what stimulate these adaptions. Think more and/or denser mitochondria, capillaries, enzymes and efficient transport ability in the muscles. The specifics of how you do the workouts to generate these changes are largely based on that fiber make up the athlete possesses. If you are heavier on the slow twitch side maybe more volume at tempo and longer runs in general will maximize your potential. Conversely, if you‚Äôre more on the fast twitch side, slightly faster paced workouts, even though you‚Äôre targeting the same adaption will bring about your optimal fitness.",

I think this one has a wind sensor, the last one definitely didn't. Much like a cycling power meter, I don't actually expect it to generate a realistic number, just as long as it's accurate. That was my issue before. It simply couldn't have been based on my testing. Whereas whilst a cycling power meter doesn't actually know your power, it's pretty consistent. This would definitely be an interesting metric if it works better than before. I'm glad you are having a play around with TSS and CTL. With your scientific background it would be interesting to see if you can index it to performance, as I know many others in cycling have, but for running. I've definitely seen patterns there and it really helped me realise training like this in singles with 3 sub Threshold days is actually a pretty damn high training load compared to how a more classic running program might be structured, for the same hours/miles. But I will reiterate that using metrics like this are only useful if you are sure the data you are collecting, is accurate. Which is why I race as often as I can, so I can update zones etc. If I say went 8-10 weeks with no racing, you can be assured I was probably getting hugely over inflated TSS scores for the back end especially for that period, if I then PB in my parkrun. There is then not much I can learn from the PMC. I probably sound like a broken record, but I can't over emphasise this enough. It's where I think 90% of people at least don't use these sort of metrics properly. I'm not doing my 10 miler until October, but I don't intend on really changing anything of my training. A month out I might double up on 2x5k weekly with one other session or throw in 4x10 mins to the mix instead of one of the shorter sessions. But very little change otherwise.",

My wrist sensor reads a little higher, but consistently higher at least, but if you want to see what's happening during the rep, the chest strap is better. Secondly, yes, your LTHR is the highest point you want your HR to be. You should be touching that on the last rep AT MOST. As an example, if you do 6x1600 and you hit nearly your LTHR on rep 2, you've gone too hard. It'll be way over by rep 6. Thirdly, for me, I don't check at all during, I trust the paces I've set that I've shared. With a lot of testing, I've found for those distances and durations I don't need to check heart rate. Naturally , even across a variety of conditions , it will keep me in that sub threshold zone in terms of HR as well as lactate tested in the past. This keeps the running very smooth as I can just focus on keeping a nice even pace in the zones I've set. One the first rep, my HR takes a while to creep up. It's probably not in the zone we are talking about until 3-4 minutes, going back to use the 6x1600 example. My HR will drop maybe 40-45 beats in the 60 seconds at the end of each rep, but will very quickly rise straight back into the target zone within a very short space of time, when I get going again. I'm not quite sure you mean for the last bit, but my experience of the Friel test is its as accurate as you can get in a field test. Do 30 minutes as a time trial, pick a distance you are likely to hit in 30 mins based off your times - for example for me I would pick maybe 8.5k and pace it like a race. Take the last 20 minutes of that run and use it's average HR, find 98% of it and then use that as your LTHR. It's definitely more accurate than taking or guessing it from races. Mine would be way too high from my recent 10k - you just can't replicate racing HR in training for a number of reasons. Say you are doing 36 mins of work in 6x1600, you should start to see the back end of the later reps creeping up towards that Friel field test LTHR. The whole point of us boxing this up into smaller reps, is the fact we can do a bigger chunk of time and running faster , at a lower lactate, than if we ran it all straight.",

There is some training benefit from this of course, but the whole point here is we are pushing to create as much lactate as we can, to get the maximum training load. It is the running version of cycling sweetspot, how I see it, in terms of getting your best bang for you buck. Over time it maximises the training load versus realistic recovery + repeatability.

Aside from being a great storyteller and incredibly warm and approachable, I appreciated the numerous qualifiers he would impart when talking about his book. He was always careful to emphasize that his tables are starting points that do not account for things like differences in economy and other individual traits of his athletes. I certainly can‚Äôt speak on his behalf, but I think the nuance and use of physiological markers to individualize training even within session would be right up his alley. Another poster a few pages back linked an article on Chris Froome using sessions with lactate over 4.0, and wondered about sessions where the Ingebrigstens go over 4.0 as well. I seem to recall from Daniels‚Äô lectures (granted, pushing 20 years ago!) an impression that there is value in teaching your body not only to clear lactate faster by doing volume below the LT, but also teaching your body to run with as little interruption to economy as possible by doing some regular running above threshold (though not too much, so as to avoid interrupting the rest of the training week). Hence, the relatively intense 20 minute tempo as well as what Daniels called cruise intervals (what we‚Äôre all describing as 5-6 minutes at 2.5-3.5 mmol lactate). I think that a system that works that 2.5-3.5 or 4.0 range exclusively may be going too far off the deep end. There is value in integrating a bit of volume above 4.0, as most of us will presumably exceed that value while racing. What the Norwegians bring to the table is the idea that the volume of running possible in the 2.5-4.0 range is extraordinarily high if done correctly, and the necessity of running anything that produces above 4.0 is minimal (though, I think, not non-existent).",

As others have noted, even a small volume above 4.0 can really be felt days later.

For example, at first he was doing 3x3k but finally stretched that to 4x3k after he started to increase his overall volume. He's at 8+ hours a week. I'm barely touching 7. Whatever I do, if you read back, I'm around 75/25 in terms of work in zones. That is split between under 70% HR in simplistic terms for the easy/75 and almost all of the 25 (apart from park runs) are sub threshold. I think this is about the limit, give or take a couple of percent. If I wanted to do more, I would actually like to see the easy creep up nearer 80%, before I added on extra distance to the sun threshold days. I think you can probably get away with low to mid 70s in terms of \"easy\" running percentage on reasonably low hours (which is what I consider my training). Much higher than the 8+ for someone like Kristoffer I, then you are into doubles territory potentially being the best way. That's a whole different ball game as I said before and definitely not what we are talking about here. Sorry to emphasis that point like a broken record, but that needs to be made very clear.",

From my own perspective, the only thing I can say is that I have gone 6 weeks before without going to a park run - so that's 18 sessions all sub threshold with nothing above - and I still pb'd that week in the 5k. So if I had to guess, not much. But overall, it's probably something. I just wouldn't want to send someone down the garden path and say it's something it's not. Like you must do this or that on top of the sub threshold work. I think as I'm UK based, ParkRun is the perfect option - you get some work in once every few weeks and in general you are probably more motivated than you are alone. Plus it's free and for most people in towns and cities, there's one you can run out to and from and it costs nothing. I would stick to the general principle that the vast majority of the work that doesn't quantify as easy, remains sub threshold. I don't want to dig around too much into the weeds of throwing other things into the mix, when I still think just sticking to this will get you very close to the maximum gain, for a reduced number of hours - with relatively limited risk factor. Oh and well done Fusio, keep it going. Nice to see someone else having success and who has crossed over from cycling. I feel your pain, the weight loss is hard.

    "msg": "Ok, this thread seems to have a bit of life back in it. So let's talk about the easy run and power. So I've said before, I like pace. I live in a flat area and I'm looking at around 65% of MAS for these runs. This is for the 3x normal runs and the long run of the week. This will normally amount to around an average of 70% Max HR, probably slightly under. I totally concede, pace is not the best metric for some people. Living in the hills etc. So I bought a Stryd, as you can see a few pages back. Previously, I didn't have much luck. But I've persisted. I'm having trouble (or was) with the sub threshold stuff, but I feel I have some really good data to feedback for those interested on the easy runs. So I did 4x easy runs blind, I just did my usual pacing and noted down the results. Then on my 5th easy run today, I tried to run ONLY to power , I didn't look at anything else but aimed for average power of the 4 previous runs. The result? The pace of the run was a bit more up and down. However, the power curve was almost flat and the result a run bang on 65% of MAS on average for the 55 minute run and 68% of max HR. Incidentally, the HR was a lot flatter. Much flatter in fact, due more even power distribution. All 5 runs it turns out were within a few \"watts\" of each other (let's use watts like that, as it's not really watts). This was at 78% of my FTP. This seems to make total sense. In the stryd zones, this is the upper end of zone 1. Much like it would be for pace and HR. So all matches up very nicely. Now I'm not saying that is the case for EVERYONE. But I know there are some guys out there interested in using power . And if you have a pretty decent idea of your FTP, I would suggest 78% is a really good starting point. This resulted in the top end of the MAS suggestion, for the easy run. So let's say 78% is the cap and work down from there.",

It‚Äôs interesting to see how the various metrics align with training and race performance too. With regard to power, something that might be of interest to the group. The power model that Stryd uses, from what I can tell, is based on the sum of three power components. The primary values that contribute to the power level, specifically if power for air resistance and elevation are not a factor, are weight (kg), speed (m/s), and ECOR. ECOR stands for energy cost of running. Based on the data Stryd provides, they use a standard ECOR value of 1.04. So the simplified power equation looks like: Power = Speed*Weight*ECOR However, if you look at their data, it shows the better a runner you are, the lower your ECOR value. They list an elite runner as having an ECOR of 0.93, an average runner as 1.01, and an untrained runner as 1.06. If you change your ECOR value from 1.04 to 1.01 in the power formula, that leads to a 2.88% REDUCTION in power, assuming speed and weight hold constant. So for those of us looking to target power for workouts and races, who are ‚Äúbetter‚Äù hobbyists, keep that in mind. Sirpoc has a good approach to go on feel and compare it to other metrics he uses. If you‚Äôre really into data, you can ‚Äúfine tune‚Äù your ECOR value by observing it over the course of your sessions and calculating it yourself from the data. ECOR = Power / (Speed*Weight) If you want to use that data to get a more accurate race time prediction (assuming similar conditions as your workouts of course), based on a targeted power level: Time = (ECOR*Distance*Weight) / Power where Distance is in meters and Time in seconds Hope that‚Äôs insightful for the nerds on the thread.

I'm way more of a hobbyjogger than most, recently PR'd with a 19:46 parkrun. I haven't had access to a lactate meter so I've erred on the side of caution and used the VDOT equivalent HM-FM paces for the workouts so far (5x5, 5x6, 8x4 minutes), HR has been creeping up to 90-92% of max by the last minute of the last rep so I'm reasonably happy with that even though the paces seem very slow for now (around 4:30/km). Will do a Friel test soon. One thing to note is that 65% of MAS and 70% of max HR for me are two completely different values - the former is a bit faster than I had been doing my easy runs prior to finding this thread and would push the HR closer to 80% of max. I tried the latter approach and was honestly shockingly slow, around 7:00/km or 11:00/mile, closer to 50% of MAS than to 65%. I'm definitely aerobically undertrained as my PR's get progressively worse as the distance increases (42:02 10k, 1:39 HM, 4:05 FM, though more recently I raced a 70:43 10mi and a 2:41:40 20mi which are still bad compared to the 5k/mile but definitely an improvement), not sure if that has something to do with it or if the body just needs to adapt to the new training load. Will try this out for a few weeks with no races (will do one 7k time trial just to get the Friel results and check my fitness levels) and race again in exactly a month's time to see the results.

If so I have a friend who has been training like this (although now I think he's given up as he just went too hard on the sub threshold days). He was the same, his HR was pretty high - but we stuck to MAS and even after a few weeks it came down quite a lot on these runs. The other option is you don't know your true max HR, but I doubt that - it wouldn't account for most of the gap and also I'm usually at or very close to max HR at parkruns so I would imagine you are as well. This is why everything I posted up was a guide , I'm sure I'm boring everyone by keeping saying this - but what I posted was what I knew definitely fit neatly for me. Go to Tinman's calculator, plug in your 5k time and from memory his \"easy\" is a little big slower than MAS. I would stick to that range maybe for now. It's definitely not going to crush you and you will be able to do your workouts the next day - take HR even off the screen on your watch for a few weeks and then after 2-3 weeks have a look at how things have improved. Your intervals now seem like they are in a good range. Slightly slower than what I've been doing proportionally, but not by much tbh and as I've said before it's better to go a little bit slower , as there's still a reasonably big sub threshold window for you to catch and fall into. It does feel slow IMO. Especially if you have been doing park runs. It's significantly slower all the time than your regular \"race\" (park run isn't a race I hear you say ha ha) pace.

Like you said, even if it's a couple of beats higher in reality it still wouldn't change much. I'm gonna try running by feel and not worry too much about HR on the easy runs as they were definitely feeling comfortable in the 75% max range, nasal breathing, relaxed, didn't feel too beat up afterwards. Hopefully HR will come down, it already has as at the start of my hobby jogging journey I made the classic error of trying to hit certain paces on my 'easy' runs and my 5:40/km went from 82-85% to more like 75% since I stopped doing that. Based on my recent 10mi race my LT pace ought to be closer to 4:20 than 4:30 but like you said lactate testing is a bit cumbersome, I definitely wanna try it at some point but for now happy just getting into a consistent rhythm with these things and using HR as a proxy.

My experience is very in line with being able to index performance levels and fitness via the PMC, but only if you collect data properly. When it comes to power, it gets more complicated. For the easy runs, it will give you a TSS almost in line with Pace. But on the workouts, because NP is used to calculate, it will give you a much higher score for TSS than via HR or pace. Today's 10x1k for examples, was 88 TSS based on power, 79 for HR and 77 for pace. So overall, power will create a higher CTL in the long run. Again, it doesn't really matter. As long as you stick to power, as your metric. Again, this isn't of use to anyone, but yourself. But keep your own data consistent. A side note.

As far as I can tell from following the thread, he was running high 18ish for a long period of time whilst following what might be a classic running program whilst racing just as regular. The actual speed or pace of someone is totally irrelevant. What hobby joggers are looking for and the smart training is looking around to see what other people are doing they are giving the greatest relative improvement to previous performance. 2. Most people were probably having a long period of hitting a plateau for a while who have shared their experience in this thread. Nothing they were doing was improving them. This seemed to work in getting the balance right and maximising training load. 3. This isn't something made up. We've had numerous references and examples of how this has been applied to cycling or triathletes previously. Maybe this is an area where running is just catching up. I especially have learned something from home to use metrics such as TSS, CTL etc. and I definitely think I can now add them to make up the package of what I understand about my training. 4. All the resources and technology available to Kristoffer, the years of research etc the family has done yet he is training like this. King of the hobby joggers, whatever you want to call him. But do you honestly think that someone from the best running families around right now, he would train like this if it wasn't optimal for hobby joggers? 5.

If you read the thread carefully about how it was applied to cycling, he mentions some times. As a tri guy his times are on the bike are bordering on true elite.

I think this is one reason a lot of people won't or don't train like this, even the basic level there is quite a bit to try and have to understand. Once you get past that, it's an interesting concept. I've seen the NAZ elite and Rosario talk about MAS and that's exactly how they convert it. As I understand it that's how we are talking about in this thread as well.",

Do threshold efforts at 20-40s off. So some sprints. Do some races to get used to pushing yourself. It is close enough for people not aiming to push the limits as to how much they can train.",

This will cause reactively your race paces at all levels get faster. You are probably less likely to get injured as well I would argue training like this. If you know how to pace or good target paces from your training it really doesn't matter you might not have run 5k pace in weeks or even into the months. Other aerobic sports have known this for a long time. I don't know why it's so hard for runners to understand.",

    "msg": "I see MAS (aka vVO2Max) has been brought up. I like using this myself, particularly when not racing. I‚Äôll usually do a 2400m time trial, which puts me around 8 minutes +/-. I know some sources suggest 5-7 minutes, but since I like using Daniels‚Äô equations and he cites 8-10 minutes as vVO2Max, I yield to his suggestion. Plus, it ensures that if anything, I‚Äôll be conservative in my pace estimates. I think it‚Äôs more practical than running 3-5 time trials to get your CS a la lexel and less tedious than blood draws for lactate. Although, it is interesting to construct your lactate curve and track it every 6 weeks, or so, over the course of a build up. The other benefit, is if you do want to target CS and other thresholds, it‚Äôs easy to do since most of them are referred to as a duration in minutes that you could race at. So, if you‚Äôre using your MAS/vVO2Max pace: 30 min (CS) = MAS/0.93 60 min (LT) = MAS/0.89 90 min = MAS/0.86 150 min = MAS/0.83 There are plenty of workouts you can come up with and perform in that pace range, specifically the 60-150 minute range, where you get in 30+ minutes of work and build that stimulus over the course of weeks and months. Like sirpoc, I‚Äôve also observed that I usually don‚Äôt exceed 65% MAS on my easy runs. I‚Äôm sure there are people who can do that (probably the really fast guys popping up on this thread to tell us how much we suck haha), but I find that two tempo sessions and a long run with tempo work mixed in, ‚Äúforce‚Äù me to run very easy otherwise.",
