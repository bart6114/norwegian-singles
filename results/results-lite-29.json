Regarding the ultras I have done 3 50s and a 50k, my best performance being an 8:50 50 mile with ~11k of climbing. I have always thought I was better the longer an event goes, and was shocked at how hard the marathon was at the end. I am comfortable doubling on easy days and have been incorporating 60/30 doubles on my those days without excess fatigue. I will ease into this build but I will at least try the double workout days and report back on how that goes. It seems like 30 minutes climbing at 15% and 12-13 minute pace will not effect my legs too much, the variable will be the aerobic load. I am planning on doing enough volume to support this, and I keep a few hours of very easy cycling (100-110 bpm) in my week to balance things out further. Regarding the time goal, yes I will likely drop this, its better for me to go into a race without expectations and not trying to hit rigid time splits. Thank you for the advice!",

You can see he's almost never working at this level. Maybe I've seen him post on Strava he busted a workout , even then he's maybe touched LTHR maybe for a couple of mins, on the last rep. Even then of course, HR is only telling a small part of the picture.

Keep in mind that LTHR is nowhere near a clean cut physiological variable that some of ya'll are trying to make it -it's a proxy of a proxy for the thing we actually care about, and there are a variety of different definitions and methods for determining it. Will LTHR change much in response to training? That depends on a few things. How developed is the athlete? How are they determining LTHR? With a relatively untrained athlete it could change a lot. With a highly trained athlete probably not so much. It may also \"change\" as a reflection of getting better at executing the method used to determine it. I'm a fairly experienced runner of reasonably high ability, but I've never done a Friel LTHR test, so if you had me go out and do that right now there's decent odds I don't get it perfect the first couple attempts -out of context it may look like I improved my LTHR, but really I probably would just poorly pace the first couple attempts. What I'm trying to get at is that speaking to this concept broadly across individuals is impossible and useless. What actually matters With sirpoc (or any other anecdote of success) the utility of analyzing their numbers is only to understand the framework such that you can take that and run your own experiment, you probably don't want to get too caught up the numbers themselves. The framework here with how it relates to LTHR is that you should mostly stay under your estimation of strict LT so you can do more of it throughout the week and repeat that week after week. This is accomplished through a balance of taking it slightly easier and the interval scheme itself simply reducing the accumulation of stress. Certain interval schemes with allow for an instantaneous effort that is harder than strict LT pace/effort, but the breaks keep the cumulative stress across the workout below strict LT.",

In his first race his cadence was about 201 ave, 210 for the last 2. So as he got faster he just increased his cadence (maybe stride at the same time - can't tell from the data), lately it seems his cadence is pretty locked so his stride must be a bit longer. So a 35+ second drop per mile in pace over a year in his 10k times and the HR has not moved an inch.

Crazy difference there. Recently tho his HR has climbed to 174 at the end of reps. That could just be summer heat maybe. So pick the middle and use 168 / 0.845 = 199 MHR Personally I think MHR is a relatively useless number in the sense u never see it in real life unless you are wearing a smartwatch while running up a mountainside from some slasher trying to kill u while taking cocaine or something. LTHR is the most important HR number and since Sirpocs race HR has not changed have to assume LTHR has not changed either. 175. Note the 174 above.",

    "msg": "I've read the whole thread. Fortunately the physiologists mostly use registered accounts so I can skip over their debates. I'm not here to report results (yet), just to register the experiment (n=1). I'm M53 with about 10 years of serious hobby jogging behind me, so not a beginner. I've already hit a steep post-50 decline and adjusted my training to get back to a shallower rate of decline. I'm also coming off a 2:57 marathon. Last year I ran a 1:22 HM, 1:04 for 10 miles, and 18:30 for 5K, to give a ballpark range of fitness. I've got a 5K coming up in 2 days. I'm going to give this method a serious try for a lot of reasons. It's a good fit for my best distances (10K-HM); I'm not much of a miler or marathoner. It's a good fit for who I am (a slow twitch, time constrained hobby jogger). I like the idea of trying to adapt elite training - I once tried to adapt Canova for hobby joggers, with pretty good results (I have a post about it somewhere). I have no marathon plans in the near future. The weather here ranges from awful to life-threatening for 3-5 months of the year, so a lot of my winter running is on an indoor track where intervals can help keep things interesting. And after 2 weeks, I'm loving it. After the marathon I took a week completely off, did light jogging for a week, and then tried to do 3 sub-threshold workouts. I started off with 6x400, then added a bit of volume each time. After 2 weeks I'm up to 3 miles of volume, 3 times per week, plus easy mileage for a total of 40-45 miles per week so far. This is the first time I've been able to hit 3 workouts a week - I tried it once with Daniels but had to back off. I'm finishing the workouts feeling refreshed and looking forward to the next one, not dreading the pain to come or worried about blowing up. Sirpoc's descriptions back in the first few pages and then more recently - he'll finish a session feeling like he's done a workout, but ready to go again - have been really useful for me. My workout paces are probably all on the slow side, from maybe 5 seconds faster than marathon pace to 1 hour/15K pace at the fastest (so 6:25-6:40/mile, approximately). I take it by feel and try to keep everything in control. I'm keeping easy days easy and lot letting them turn into uptempo steady pace runs. If 3 x 3 miles total at HMP as cruise intervals per week doesn't sound like much, keep in mind that it's (so far) 100% sustainable. My recent marathon buildup was a mess due to weather and minor injury/illness and family emergencies, so I would do a big workout, then have to recover with a long stretch of easy running. Lots of modulation between major efforts and recovery days. The reality is that in my buildup since January, I only averaged 6 miles of workout volume per week, mostly at MP. So a couple weeks in, just doing basic workouts, I'm already 50% above that in terms of workout volume, and at a faster pace. I'm planning to hold here for a while, then build to 4 miles of workout volume in August/September. We'll see how it goes, but it seems very doable right now. At 4 miles of volume, 3 workouts a week would give me as much consistent training load as 2 workouts a week with 6 miles, which seems a lot harder. I feel like I detrain quickly - I definitely notice it if I take 2 days off in a row - and the schedule that gives me a stimulus of faster running basically every other day seems to have some benefits over one big workout every week or two. And at 3 x 4 miles per week, I'll still have lots of room to progress over the winter. I have to adapt the program slightly. I'm using a subjective mix of pace, HR and RPE to guide me. I have to add 5-6 surges/strides to my warm-up, progressing up to MP, just so I can get on pace for the first rep; I'm old, and trying to roll straight into MP doesn't go well. And I only run 6 days per week. I've tried E-St-E-St-E-St and mixing the St repeats into the longer E run. Eventually I'll see if I can do St-E-St-E-St-Long. I'll be back with results eventually, and random contributions before then.",

Felt strong and controlled throughout--I didn't go out super fast--let everyone pass me early on--for fear of dying to 7:40 splits. My goal was to run negative splits. It sucked 2.5 miles in, which is normal for a 5k and I had to hang on until the end. I wish I had a better kick but to be fair it was not an A race, just a fitness check to see where I am at in my training (marathon build plus just general fitness). I also haven't practiced kicking in a race like this either. That HR (Garmin Fenix 5S, a good watch and not cheap), was WAY low. I would think I'd have it around 190-200 at 5k effort (which it was). I know wrist monitors are not 100% accurate but if it was something like 175-180 (instead of 190) for 5k that would make more sense. But 152-155 is tempo pace...

I know the Norwegian method for hobby joggers isn't about quick results, but that's actually a slightly better result than my recent marathon, so I'm happy with it, and it's a bit faster than I ran on the same course 2 years ago. So that's my benchmark. We'll see where this goes over the next 3-12 months. Jecht, why are you only running one subthreshold workout a week? 20:01 is a fine result, and races can vary a lot with the weather and the course.

Consistence is my most important area of improvement, so I think running consistently more and maybe also some faster workouts will give me progression regardless of method.
