(Q = quality, i.e., sub-threshold). Sub-threshold work should comprise 20-25% (MAYBE 30%) of total time spent running during the week. So if you run 50mpw in 7 hours, you should run a total of 84-105 mins of sub-threshold per week, or or 28-35 minutes per session. Sub-threshold is a STATE not a pace. For trained runners, if LT2 threshold is 4.0-4.5mmol, a sub-threshold session should aim to reach ~2.5-3.5mmol measured at the end of the last rep. You don't necessarily need a lactate test / lactate meter if you generally follow the paces below. But in my personal experience, I would say when first starting out, to run a bit slower than the below, as it seems that when you are adjusting to the volume, lactate can run a little higher. Reaching sub-threshold can be done with a virtually unlimited combination of interval distances, paces, and rest periods. The most common are: Or in terms of time-based intervals, the most common are: Looks like some people do 400m / 1 minute reps with 30\" rest at 10K pace occasionally as well. Rest can be standing, walking, or jogging - goal is to just keep the rest short to maintain lactate state. On easy runs, keep them extremely EASY. Absolutely no higher than 65% of MAS (your max pace you can hold for 6 minutes) or 70% of max heart rate. No need to do VO2max or harder \"x-factor\" workouts (e.g., hills) until you stop progressing on this method. Would note, sirpoc does a 5K parkrun race every 4-5 weeks, so he might be getting some stimulus from that. But he noted he has gone 10 weeks without racing and still had big PBs after. The main hypothesis behind this method is that you can accumulate significantly more training stress (measured by pace-based TSS) over a given period of time vs. a traditional Daniels approach (track workout, tempo, long run), with the same or less fatigue / injury risk. The key is to always err on the slower side and not go over your LT threshold (even when feeling good) as that leads to disproportionate fatigue for the training stress, and can very quickly build up and leave you trashed. Sirpoc (the key poster in this thread) has shown over the course of several months that this method has consistently produced very impressive PBs. To be fair, he is an N of 1. I am personally giving this method a try and will report back. Hope that summarizes it.",

One thing I will add to the excellent post by \"summary\" on the previous page, is I am NOT saying this is the way you must train or the only way to train. Maybe in the middle of the pages, what has got lost is the CTL and TSS talk (I think I explained it reasonably well, as quite a few people I speak to regularly are using it?). What I have always said and maintain - this being the key point; is that if you are correctly tracking your data, daily TSS and CTL , there's a good chance that you will be fitter/faster , the higher it goes, pretty much no matter HOW you get there. My example before was when I was injured on the bike, I did the turbo trainer for an insane amount of time day after day, raised my CTL to record heights and did a power PB with a healed collarbone a few weeks later. This was purely zone 1/2 riding. But the point being with sub threshold, it's the easiest/quickest way to get a high CTL (fitness score for those not using intervals icu, same thing) being time crunched and without the extra injury risk the real hard stuff brings (as well as the relative extra recovery needed). I could get the same CTL riding sweetspot, in around half the time I did with all that easy riding and my power the next year was almost identical. I just thought I would add that, as I think that is being lost a bit. I stick by my initial posts on paces (Hard2find I think has provided an amazing resource) but this isn't the only way to train. A big \"if\" but if my body could handle a Daniels schedule on more hours I'm doing now (spoiler, it likely can't) , then I would probably get faster . FWIW , I'll put this out there, stuff I have shared with jiggy, Hard2find and shirtboy, is that since my CTL was \"50\" (that was as high as I could get it a more classic style) by pb at 5k has roughly gone up 8 seconds, for every extra CTL point. It's not perfectly near, but there is a clear pattern and trend. Final note on that, I'm also working on the assumption for running, as it was on the bike it didn't really matter HOW I increased my training load, each CTL point was worth about 1.5w in FTP, up to the point I literally couldn't fit anymore into my lifestyle. Anyway, I don't get a huge amount of time at the moment to contribute to this thread as much as I want, but hopefully some of your find that interesting and just to clear up I'm not saying this is the way you HAVE to train, but I still say based on the experience from both sports and seeing what others are doing, it's likely going to get you there in the most time efficient way.",

Whenever freshman or transfers would come in, using RPE for their entire running careers previously, they always overestimated threshold. Every single time without fail. The point isn’t to use HR as the only metric. HR and blood lactate testing help you dial in RPE. After a few tests you can use HR as a guide. It really helps you dial in the effort. I now live in an area with a lot of sub-elite runners. None of them use HR or have tested their blood. They all go off RPE. They swear it feels easy.
