If you follow Gabriela DeBues-Stafford on Strava, she talks about this in her most recent workout. She plans on keeping track work (sounds like 200s or short reps at mile pace) in her rotation. I’m wondering if frequent strides and frequent races will fix this “stuck in threshold” issue? Or it could be something different that is contributing to the struggle with racing faster. Maybe these athletes feel flat from doing their threshold too fast. Gabriela DeBues-Stanford did a double threshold on a Tuesday, felt like trash on Wednesday and Thursday but still did another double threshold on Thursday, which she had to cut short because her lactate was too high. Obviously this thread is not about double thresholds but I think a lot of people are a bit nervous about neglecting fast work in this program.",

    "msg": "I'll weigh in on my experience. 41M (5'11\", 150 lbs), ran in XC way back in high school (slow for the team, ~18:50 5k), decided to start running again 2 winters ago, don't really race, did a 10k in 44:00 last fall. Was running 30-40 MPW with 1 Daniels Style hard session, a long run, and a bunch of random Z2-3 miles. Was making some progress (trying to build to 40-50 MPW) but was feeling sore quiet often after the hard stuff. Got sick in February and tried to run through it, burnt myself out and took a few weeks off. After building back up in March/April to 40-50 MPW doing Z1-Z2 stuff, I stumbled on this thread and the idea of less hard stuff and more sub-T to stay on my feet seemed appealing so I decided to give it a go and stick to the plan for 10-12 weeks and see what happens. Weeks have all been the same. Last LTHR test was about 173, kept Max HR at the end of the subT workouts closer to 168-170. M - Easy 6 Miles Tu - 3x2k (~7:15/mile) w/ 1 minute recovery + WU/CU W - Easy 6 Miles Th - 7x1k (~7:00/mile) w/ 1 minute recovery + WU/CU F - Easy 6 Miles S - Easy 6 Miles Sun - Long 10 Miles(3 Easy, 4 @ 7:30 pace, 3 Easy) Basically, 50 Miles a week, 12 miles at sub-T (20%), All the rest done in upper Z1/lower Z2 (9-10 minute pace), repeated since May 1. Did a 5k TT on February 15 just before getting sick: Finally ran another one yesterday: Needless to say, I'm pretty bummed. I was hoping for a strong signal that the work had some effect. Thoughts: - I feel like I'm generally fitter, I've jumped up and additional 15-20 MPW and I feel much stronger on the larger workload. Very rarely sore, fine to repeat sub-T workouts 3x a week. Way different experience than Jan/February. - I feel like I'm really comfortable running in the 7-7:30/mile pace now. - That 5k felt way different than the hard running from over the winter. Almost Like my body doesn't remember how pull hard and maintain it, I ended up falling back to my workout pace by the end of it. - If I squint real hard I could say it was 40F hotter and way more humid out and I ran the same time (same course) at 4 BPM lower HR (even though I faded). I don't know if it's just the heat or that I haven't really pressed myself in almost 3 months and I forgot what time trial/race pace effort feels like or if this type of work is just not the stimulus I respond to. Was there any progress here? I don't know. I'm tempted to stick it out another few weeks and maybe run another 5k or two to see if it's just a matter of knocking the cobwebs out of my legs.",

Ran another TT same course a few weeks later, felt way better and ran 30 secs faster. There’s a lot to be said for “remembering how to hurt” at race pace. I think a race or at least a 3-5k TT every 3-5 weeks is very valuable with this training. I’d at least keep at it until cooler weather hits in the fall.

The good news: I then did a month of conventional training and speed work and took 15s off my 5k PB. Whilst I performed embarrassingly badly off the subT work, I think it gave me the aerobic base to build on when I piled on some intensity. In future I plan to cycle between base phase (easy+speed), SubT, and then a conventional block.

If you are looking to race mostly 5ks I think it would benefit to have some shorter distance repeats at faster distances. You are getting enough mileage but your fastest workout (7x1k) is at 7 minute pace. That's still slower than your current 5k pace that you aren't happy with. So it doesn't seem like that much of a surprise that you have trouble maintaining a faster pace when you never train at that faster pace for any distance. If you want to keep 2 repeats a week, then I would remove the 3x2k and replace it with 20x400m or 12x600m workout with 30 sec rest at your perceived 5k pace. Or a workout similar. Or just add that workout to your existing for 3 total and alternate days from easy 6 and your repeats/long run. I know it shifts all your workouts every week to a different day but that's what I do as it allows me to get 3 repeat workouts in and a long run in an 8 day timeframe without any of them ever being back to back.

Anything over 65 F and the effects start to become It is to the point where, as I do this mainly for times and PRs, I don’t even bother racing if it is over 70.

A big part of the discrepancy at the moment is that I’m not very fit yet due to the time off. That 5th mile at 5:30 spikes me too high. But doing 6 x mile a bit slower, I typically test pretty low until the last rep, where I see a bit of a spike. Eventually, as my ability to clear lactate improves, I expect to see smaller spikes in lactate with the increases in volume.

In this system, your time at sub-threshold should be between 20% and 25% of your weekly mileage. If you're running ~7 hours a week that's around 90 minutes of sub-threshold. Three sessions each with ~6 miles of volume would achieve this. If you're running less then shortening the sessions to fewer reps would be appropriate. Your pace during these sessions should be dictated by whatever keeps you in the right lactate zone. This can be achieved by looking at any of a number of metrics (HR, pace and lactate testing are the popular ones). So if you're choosing lactate as your metric then yes you'll have to run a little faster to get the same lactate reading as your threshold increases, but your goal would be to hit the lactate measurement rather than to increase your pace.",

When the recovery was extended to 60 seconds, the athlete could average 62s. Both produced the same lactate levels at the end (just slightly below LT2). Therefore, you could keep the same volume in your workouts, but extend the recoveries to keep the intensity in the threshold range. Personally, I'd drop the volume just slightly at first (maybe down to 5 miles), and then gradually lift - just to be on the conservative side.",

I started the block with a 6 x1600m lactate test. From that data, I defined my speed at LT (vLT) and my heart rate at LT (LTHR). In my specific case, I could be as high as 110% of LTHR while running at a speed less than vLT and reading lactate around 1.5-2.5 mmol/l. Where as, if I was in that same heart rate range as a result of running faster than vLT, my lactate varied from about 2.0 to 5.0 mmol/l.

For instance, on a treadmill, indoors, in an optimal temperature and humidity, there will be less variability than in a hot and humid environment where even running at an easy pace for long enough can drive your heart rate to LTHR (depending on your definition). So, in my experience, context matters. In fact, I’m planning to repeat this experiment on a treadmill indoors and again outdoors when the weather improves. If I am wrong (meaning if the variance is not reduced), I will personally buy you a pair of super shoes for your sub 20 minute 5k attempt! You’ll need them : ) Furthermore, to address controlling for one of your nutritional concerns (hydration), I’ve invented a portable, though not potable, device called The Six Shooter. It’s a digital hydration analysis station you can take to the track and set on the infield at the finish line for a 6 x 1600m session. At the end of each repeat, just center yourself over it and urinate into one of the six 8 oz cylinders. Voila, now hydration status can be accurately accounted for! Disclaimer, company will not be held liable for indecent public exposure. As for defining LT. I’ll just reiterate that I chose to use Dmax, which is not LT1, nor LT2. It’s just a method that results in a point on the lactate curve, approximating LT, as the result of a mathematically defined method. You literally made the point, but then somehow missed the point, that there is not a well defined nor agreed upon “threshold” value to use. So, I was simply using the Dmax value to define a basis for vLT and LTHR. I could have chosen modified Dmax, LT1, LT2, 2.0 mmol/l, 4.0 mmol/l, OBLA 1 to infinity... With in reason, it’s all arbitrary. Lastly, yes, I am very much a “slow twitch dominant” runner.

I could have stuck with using the raw speed and heart rate as well, but thought it would be more relatable in percentage terms. And again, you keep using LT2 when I never mentioned that. I chose to use LT generically, similar to how the researchers in the universal running equation paper you linked chose to define LT as the baseline lactate value plus a constant term (I believe 1.5 mmol/l). Some researchers even use the term LT to represent LT1 and LTP to represent LT2. Maybe you can bother them instead.
