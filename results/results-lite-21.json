My guess is that you could aim for shorter reps (5x6min or 10x3 min on Tues, 25x60s on Thursdays), then do the usual hill session (10x30s if working into shape, then build up to 2x10x30s if it's not too much) that the Norwegians do on Saturdays, with two days easy afterward. The hills are intense but easier on the joints than track sessions. Muscular power and anaerobic capacity become more important to train here if races are shorter, but I think implementing threshold sessions is still helpful for raising aerobic capacity.

Unfortunately, most hobby joggers tend to fall into the 5k through Marathon range. This approach for what my 2 cents is worth, is likely the best way I've ever seen for someone on 5-9 hours a week. Even if you just use the pace guide , which might need shifting around a little bit as per individual due to being at different aerobic stages ....it's well within what's reasonable for most people who have some aerobic background to just plug and play. Now, 800 is so specific and I have coached quite a few people here..... that I think you have to probably accept that if you are an 800/1500 guy, I wouldn't train like this. If you are a 1500/5k guy, absolutely I would almost not change anything other than some hills maybe every second or third week outside of the race season. The 800 though is just so specific , it's probably the most fun when you get it right, but the hardest to get to that point. I really don't think this is THE thread for 800 guys, there's better and more important stuff to focus on.

Giving oneself a small periodization phase prior to an upcoming mid-distance race where there is a focus on speed is a well-documented practice in sports science literature. There's no reason why it can't be done for hobby joggers, it's not that hard to implement. The 200/300/400 reps should be run at race pace, so they're not being run all out. Just like people are slightly modifying sirpoc's training for marathon training by including a few longer LR sessions, you can slightly modify it ~6 weeks before an upcoming race like the 1500 by replacing some of the sub-T sessions with race-pace 200s/300s/400s.

    "msg": "I don't have a huge amount of data for running, all I know for me (so far) is I can plot CTL / 5k performance reasonably neatly. So far, more is more. I suspect, there's a cut off with this. In terms of you max out your aerobic capacity and you can probably get by with less CTL, for the same performance and add in hills, speed work. I'm not there yet, I don't think. My guess, as would be with cyclists on time crunched (mainly being top amateur/ sub elite time trialists in the UK) that you probably won't reach the point where this is a huge factor. I'm talking 9 hours a week or less. 8 hours is the point in which I've got in my head I might have reached diminished aerobic returns and have to try something else to add in. But time will tell. A guy way smarter than me on the old TT forums, did his own study of a number of people's training and how the acquired CTL matches with performance. The general jist was, the difference in FTP at a given CTL for each individual, was probably +-10% spread, if you consider what is the absolute worst training schedule you could do (my z2 for weeks and weeks and hours and hours on end) versus the best bang for buck, being sweet spot. Basic example , CTL of 60. A sensible, generic training plan might generate a FTP of 300. The worst training you could do, just aimlessly riding, but generating the same CTL, might get you can FTP of 270 (note it would take you way longer in time to also reach the same CTL) . A really well thought out, sweetspot block of 6 months might scrape out 330w ( in much less time riding). All for the same CTL of 60. That's the extreme end. For me, I was a much narrower range , where X CTL basically equalled Y power from a baseline of about 160-70w untrained and a CTL of 0. The guy I talked to a lot about this was a swimming coach, he found it also applied to swimmers he'd known and triathlon specialists. To me, something along these lines makes perfect sense for running, albeit with some small running specific factors etc, mainly the ability to absorb pretty big punishment on the body. But in a nutshell, it's roughly what I've stuck to, followed the plan, the numbers and I'm still seeing the improvements I'm happy with and would expect to see. Incidentally , again, this would need bigger studies, there are two people who messaged me direct on Strava (I think one has posted in this thread) who have adapted this to do marathon pace work , so right at the bottom of the sub threshold range and they have racked up huge CTL numbers in 6 + months and without even really thinking about it. One set a 5k PB and one set a 10k PB. Sadly, neither had accurate historical data from years past, but the main takeaway was from talking to them, that almost certainly in terms of overall load, they were both just doing much more than they ever had, but just in a controlled manner/ racking up the training load. Much like I was shocked when I suddenly hit a power pb after a big crash and just riding the turbo aimlessly to keep myself busy. I stand by that nearly a year on, it's probably likely to make most people improve, but as we have seen with some cases in the Strava group, it's very easy to get it wrong and come unstuck like other training modes, if you go too hard. Ultimately, most of us here are hampered by our aerobic capacity. Training like this is pushing it up from below, even at what seems like pretty easy running levels.",

My longest run this time a couple of weeks out was 30k easy. It's the slowest pace and shortest distance I've done as my big last run and I've ran 7 Ms now. Even with the long run I made sure my sub threshold didn't take a bit of backseat. I felt super strong even past 30k to go on race day. I assumed I would hit the wall at some point, it basically never came. To add, my build didn't feel anything special until around 12 weeks in and I knew this time would be different. I have never felt fresh in a marathon plan at 3 months before. All I changed as you know was the long run was longer on a Sunday @usually 110-120 mijs and the Thursday session was longer at 5x9 mins , at M pace . Other two sub threshold were a mixture of the ones you have been doing. Standard 10*1k up to 3*3k. I had no intention of going for a 5k. But happened as happy accident. My guess now with my new found understanding, in the past for 5k I was totally obsessed with speed!!! Speed , speed , speed and more speed workouts. When actually, I was just embarrassingly under developed in an aerobic sense. M was a PB hugely and a 45 second 5k PB as well. Two for the price of one!! I see others have been asking about the M.

    "msg": "I hope you recover fast and keep us posted! Saw a related article from RW UK. Unlike the American RW, it's more technical and delves into definitions of tempo/threshold/sub-threshold: Terminology in running can be confusing. If you're wondering about the differences between threshold and tempo running, I'm afraid I can't give a straight answer. For some runner and coaches, tempo running refers to longer efforts at a slightly lower intensity, which you might be able to hold for two to three hours in a race (closer to lactate threshold). For others, it's a run at a pace slightly stronger than lactate turnpoint, closer to 30 to 40-minute race pace, while some use tempo running and threshold running interchangeably. Sometimes, it's better to just say what you mean: for example, run for a pace you could hold for 40 to 60 minutes in a race, run at this heart rate, etc. Or can you make it even simpler – easy, steady, strong, hard, for example. There are a few good workouts that are somewhat similar to those posted here: If you’re just starting out or racing over shorter distances (1500m to 5K), then 15 to 25 minutes at this effort is enough. For half-marathon or marathon training, consider building to 30 to 50 minutes of effort as you get closer to race day. Warm up well and include 15 to 25 mins of running at threshold effort before cooling down. : When you’re in top condition, add a 30 to 60-sec surge up to 5 to 10K pace every five minutes to improve your ability to buffer lactate. Start easy and build gradually to include a block of threshold running towards the latter stages of a continuous run. For example, 15 mins easy, 15 steady and 15 at threshold effort. : Pick a flat or rolling route and run out for 22 mins, building to a steady effort. Run the same route back, aiming to finish in 40 mins. Splitting threshold sessions into long efforts with short, easy or steady recoveries can allow you to extend the amount of time you spend at threshold effort, or run slightly quicker while keeping your intensity under control. For example, 6 x 5 mins with 60-sec easy recoveries, or 3 x 10-15 mins with 2-min easy-to-steady recoveries. : Split sessions allow you to vary your paces. Try 12 mins, 10 mins, 8 mins and 4 mins, with 90-sec recoveries. Start at a pace you could hold for 60 to 70 mins in a race and work down to 30 to 45-min race pace.",

There is a potential for an absolute huge study to come off the back off this thread, but it's very important to keep in mind that this method or training still is niche and the long term it needs top produce results, isn't great for intervention studies. I think there could be a good bit drilled down into the hows and whys of all this and some real good science could come of it, but I don't think lexel for instance constantly spamming the thread with CV. Even when he has a point, he loses the point. What has me very curious is what sirpoc mentioned also from training load, performance and how that load is acquired.

In which guys just do lots of running, way more than normal for say an ultra or such, then PB at all distances.

He certainly has experience making hypothesis and testing the results and in that way he is scientifically oriented. This is what I was trying to get at in the above post about CTL and TSS. It's a very different approach to training than most runners (myself included!) are accustomed to. That's also why it's so fascinating. It's different and it works. As runners we've been conditioned to think primarily physiologically. Any training argument that Jack Daniels, Steve Magness, or Pete Pfitzinger makes, for example, is primarily about physiology and NOT load accumulation. When Spiroc is comparing 3 sub threshold a week to a Jack Daniels plan, his argument isn't about vLT, VO2 max, Aerobic threshold, economy or anything physiologically oriented. It's basically that a JD plan beats you up too much for a lower load. In the long term you can accumulate more load more consistently with 3 sub threshold runs. If you're trying to PR in 8 weeks, a JD plan will probably be better. But in 8 months, the argument goes, 3 sub threshold is way better because you create much more load and you can do it over and over again (more on that later). That doesn't mean Spiroc isn't scientifically minded, it just means he's thinking about it from a different angle. This is much more natural for cyclists because power is such a reliable metric. This is another reason why pace based TSS is important. Although it isn't perfect, at least it's load measure that's relative to performance, where as heart rate based TSS (physiologically oriented) is an indirect measure that will have much less correlation to performance. Spiroc and cyclists in this camp seem to be thinking more in terms of work in, work out, numbers in numbers out, not \"what physiological system am I working on.\" Do more work, smarter, and you get better. In this approach, there isn't a lot of the other stuff we commonly see in programs: taxing long runs, up weeks and down weeks, peaking, large tapers, strides, race pace focus, periodization etc. The reasoning why this program doesn't include those basically boils down to how much load those methods create, in how much time, requiring how much recovery. This doesn't mean that physiology isn't important! I would be very interested in all of the tests mentioned above to see what's happening 'under the hood' with this approach. This approach uses physiology to control training intensity. Rather than use physiology as a tool to discern what workout uses what physiological system, this approach just uses it to ensure we're not overdoing it. Easy runs at <70% HR Max and Sub T under 4. mm (generalizing here) is more about the recovery needed than the stimulus provided. Threshold runs at 4.2 will provide negligible load compared to 3.8. But over weeks and weeks of tipping over the threshold, fatigue accumulates and it's no longer sustainable. The lactate testing and easy runs are about ensuring there is a positive load to recovery needed ratio. Stay on the positive side of that for a while and the fitness will come.",

It was a big mental shift for me, and my RPE was completely skewed because I was severely overtrained in college – hard 8k race pace intervals from 5:00 to 5:10 pace regularly with long tempos at 5:25-5:30 pace. I stagnated at around 26:00s for 8k and 15:10s for 5k, thinking I couldn't train hard enough. Since I was going hard so frequently, I think my body was anaerobically overtrained. I could get from hard interval to interval just fine (thinking that being able to finish was about 18 RPE), but sustained paces were much more challenging. As it turns out, I was a \"Theo Quax\" case. I got my lactate threshold tested in laboratory at the university, and I guess my true threshold corresponded to 5:50-6:00 pace, much slower than my previous workout paces. It also seems astonishingly low for a 15:10 guy, but that is where I started and am getting near 14:50s now after trying this method, recalibrating my own RPE, and literally crawling at 5:55-6:00 for a while (now more comfortable at 5:40-5:50). I do think my body benefited from previously having high muscular strength from quick intervals, but interesting that I am improving after slowing down my workouts so much (and that my threshold range is so slow for my PRs – slower than Kristoffer Ingebrigtsen despite having faster PRs!). Anyway, just thought I'd share how variable thresholds can be, with some outliers like Theo and myself needing to slow down more than most to find improvement.

Really had to ditch the ego for both easy runs and threshold workouts. In case this is helpful, I mostly started with 3x10min (Tues), 5x6min (Thurs), 25x1min (Sat), then upped the volume a bit for the Tues/Thurs sessions (so 3x12min and 5x8min) after 4 months since I'm a bit higher mileage (70ish mpw, not quite enough to justify double threshold). Every 2-3 weeks I'll still toss in a hard VO2 interval session in there (or do hill repeats) just to \"feel fast\" (part of it was me trying to prove whether this training method was working for me) or replace a race effort, and I feel very strong at those paces still. I does take a bit longer to \"feel\" recovered from them than before, but maybe that's just because I'm finally giving my body a chance to repair now instead of hopping back to 6:30 pace the the next couple days.

Whereas, of course if you run 5k pace in workouts , your legs won't fall off, but cumulatively you won't be able to run as much. The 5k pace work is undone by need for days off , really easy days or down weeks. I think CHillruns posts recently have really helped provide outside context. I wasn't aware sirpoc TT regularly.

The reason is, this system works on lactic acid utilization and if you stagnate, it probably means you need to teach your body to produce more lactic acid, so that you have more \"fuel\". Most people accomplish this by either strides, \"150s\" or (like you said) mile pace 200s. I think 400-800 pace 200s with longer rest is better for this purpose because you'll produce more lactic acid. This is also the \"last 5%\" type of thing, your stagnation is from focusing on this 5% rather than the 95% that is threshold training, which means you probably have a lot more potential than you think, just look at sirpoc dropping MINUTES off his 5k (big relationship to the mile) not even including that faster work.",

I was 19:20 for the 5k. I had been running roughly 2 years. I follow a few different plans, they usually result in the sense issue. Breakdown, injury, just after running somewhere in 19. I reset in September my training to this. I would say until Santa Claus came, nothing and I was very disappointed. I felt strong on intervals, but not doing fast work felt silly, slow and honestly I almost throw this in the trash and come here to say how silly this is. But then a remarkable happened, I just decided to set off on a 5k solo TT at my local track here in the province. I thought I would set myself to pace around 19 flat, right from start. I expected to fail. But I didn't. I never had feel so strong a feeling and whilst my legs maybe didn't have training at that speed, my aerobic was so strong and I could just hold the pace I set out at. I even managed to kick at last lap and finish solo TT in 18:48. I couldn't believe. Now more months on. I just broke 18 for 17:56 in my local race now weather is better.

    "msg": "Chill Runs, very thoughtful post! This is the type of discussion I’ve been waiting for since TSS was first brought up! As far as I can tell, in trying to discern how Andrew Coggan derived TSS, it seems he used the percent of 60 minute race pace (which he called FTP or Jack Daniels would call T-pace) and the percent of the lactate value at that pace (based on using a power function to model the lactate curve) to assign stress points. Then scaled it so that the score for a 60 minute race effort would be equivalent to 100 TSS. Sirpoc shared with me some old cycling threads Coggan posted in and he himself states that TSS is not a system meant to represent physiological stress, strictly training stress. I share all that only to set up this next point. As I interpret your post and the general validation for using TSS from others, it seems to reduce to maximizing training load, so CTL. That long-term training stress is thus dependent on the TSS equation. So, with that in mind, consider this. A score of 60 TSS can be achieved in many ways, three of which are 55 minutes at 80% FTP, 36 minutes at 100% FTP, and 30 minutes at 110% FTP. To put that in terms of Jack Daniels 80% FTP is E-pace, 100% FTP is T-pace, and 110% FTP is I-pace. So, according to the TSS equation, those three workouts would be equivalent in stress. Now, I don’t expect strike zone accuracy, but being in the ball park seems a reasonable expectation. Does any runner think those are even close? If I made it to 30 minutes at I-pace, I’ll have also made it to heaven, because I’d be dead haha. Contrast that with 55 minutes at E-pace (which I think many feel is more like a moderate pace). That’s something I could do regularly, particularly if I’m not doing any workouts. To be fair, and I do try, Coggan designed this system based on training by power for cyclists, so there is that consideration. However, if the underlying equation which is quantifying training stress is so skewed, how seriously should it be treated in an attempt to generalize an explanation on? I think the poster lactate_guided pointed this out… TSS, while directionally accurate, is likely not a predictor of race performance nor physiologically accurate. Another way to possibly frame this, if training load, as determined by TSS, is the driver of fitness, one should be able to achieve the same race results on the same CTL score, no matter the intensity distribution. I imagine that if most people took their weekly average intensity, it would fall between 75-80% FTP? That’s probably a little slower than Daniels E-pace for most. If you simply ran that pace, for the same amount of hours per week, do you think your race results would be the same? I think the workouts matter, but so too does the individual and their physiological make-up. Another observation, and this may just be that many on this thread are from a cycling background and/or are new to running? There seems to be this suggestion that runners have no concept of training load or haven’t thought of this type of approach/mindset before? I can think of several examples just on LRC, going back to the early 2000’s, that would suggest that assessment to be unfair. Tinman started a thread, “no interval work success” where the whole discussion basically promoted and shared experiences of runners training exclusively in the easy to threshold pace range. John Kellogg practically wrote a book, “The Training Wisdom of John Kellogg”, which a poster compiled somewhere, on how he coached Wejo to a massive 10km pr of 28:06 doing almost exclusively base work (i.e. volume and threshold). Hadd, whose original thread may be longer than this one (?), outlined what is essentially this method, but based on HR instead of lactate. And though it wasn’t on this site, to show that Andrew Coggan isn’t the only PhD with a training stress point system, Jack Daniels published his own point system for tracking training stress in his second edition. Which, bringing it back to LRC, a user programmed into an Excel workbook at the time and shared on this site (jiggymeister, you may want to look for that version haha). There are even more flamboyant (though likely unknown) coaches like Lyle Knudson who’ve promoted near daily threshold running (sorry sirpoc and shirtboy, the experiment has already been run, literally haha). Lastly, sirpoc leading on that he’s not scientific is a bigger troll job than JS Wizard ever leveled on this thread haha. He’s far more keen minded than he credits himself as.",

That's been the bulk of the work since last August. Mile reps have come down from 6:10-ish to 5:50 over that time at the same effort. Looking at my training log for the past four weeks, in this period I've done about 12k at quicker than 10k pace, half of which came from racing. Two 1500m races, a 3k race, the second half of one workout (5k pace down to 1500m pace), one full workout (1500-3k pace) and a handful of long strides at the end of another workout (1500m pace).

I agree with a lot you say Hard2find but I also fully agree with sirpoc . He has hit the nail on the head about what a lot of cyclists and triathlon guys already know, the difference in performance between the best way to train and gain CTL vs the worst, will result in not really as much a spread of power / fitness than you would think. The makeup of TSS does matter, but definitely not as much as people have suspected. Two things seemed to be the case when I was chatting on slow twitch years ago. 1. People who trained via sweetspot like this method does for running , could gain CTL the quickest, stay freshest and CTL and performance was linear 2. The people who did huge volume for something like an ultra IM, but a lot of it was easy, still were reporting they got around the same power gains at the same CTL despite doing nothing as hard. It just took longer to get to the same CTL . It was maybe as sirpoc reported, maybe 5% less power . So again this shows there is a best or worst way to train, but margin or error is narrow. This system laid out by sirpoc just happen to be the system that maybe seems to gain CTL the easiest way, stay fresh but also the most efficient. I don't think actually this is the best way to train. If plausible for example you can get 70 CTL via Daniel's and 70 CTL by sirpoc method, Daniel's might be better, at top end of spectrum of that 10% margin of effort for CTL Vs performance. But point being, take that random CTL number I use example, you probably can't get to 70 CTL by Daniel's method, break down, too tired, body won't allow but you could or can via sirpoc method. CTL and TSS not perfect but I think it can provide us some good guide here. What needs happening is someone produce a system like Coggan but we agree on how to apply it broadly to running. I think this would work nicely on track, flat, constant , but more difficult for people who don't live in flat etc to use pace. Maybe Hard2find seems like smart guy he is the one for job!

That further leads to the theory that more time spend around LT2 (sub-CV), recruits type IIa fast twitch fibers for a longer duration and that leads to the improvement in CR (cost of running). Total time spend around LT2, consistent over some period, seems to be important. TSS/CTL is not a good index for that and in general (agree with H2find), and can be easily falsified.

He is intentionally making fully provable misrepresentations in an effort to induce consumers to pay for his services, including misrepresenting himself as multiple people with false handles. This goes well beyond fun and games as he is clearly doing this to further his pecuniary interests. There is no doubt a court and jury would find this to be the case. With this knowledge, by allowing him to continue to post on your site, you will be found liable for conspiracy. If Jan makes one more post, my office will absolutely file a criminal complaint with the U.S. attorney’s office and pursue this matter in U.S. Federal District Court for D.C. We will also pursue interpol to arrest this man and bring him to justice. I am not kidding. I am very well connected with the U.S. Attorney’s office in multiple districts.",

    "msg": "I think it's a bit of a misnomer to look at this as mainly a cost of running (O2 consumption at a certain speed) matter when it's also (arguably more) about increasing the budget we have to spend. Running a lot at around threshold effort pushes up LT1 and LT2 so we can run relatively faster within a sustainable effort. It's the ability to sustain a higher % of max O2 consumption and thus run faster at sustainable speeds. Running economy involves a bunch of different factors that contribute in different ways (musculoskeletal, neuromuscular, bioenergetic, etc). The aerobic training of fast/intermediate fiber types looks like an issue of efficiency when looking at all these factors collectively, but in large part that efficiency is achieved by improving the bioenergetic capacity of these fibers -a bigger budget to spend so we spend more (run faster) without going bioenergetically bankrupt. While I'm not a fan of TSS/CTL as the leading/only metric of training load in running (and I don't use it currently myself), I think it makes sense within in the context in which it's being used here. It's being used for the optimization of training within relatively narrow parameters already set by common sense. If we are primarily addressing an issue of bioenergetic capacity the optimal solution is likely going to be just throwing as much training load at is as we can sustain. The ways in which TSS/CTL could really be \"falsified\" are outside of the common sense bounds we've already set so it's not a huge concern.",

Adds to it all! I pretty much agree with what you are saying. Training like this as sirpoc has laid out, I suspect CTL pace based metric is a fantastic tool. It's a narrow range and in my experience sweetspot is predicted very, very well by Coggan's original formula when it comes to power. I suspect more is more, until it's not. The higher you can get your CTL training like this method laid out, you'll almost certainly be faster. I also broadly agree with sirpoc and other posters, the difference between training systems and CTL reached per individual, is not that large. I've seen other cases in cycling especially like sirpoc where you can predict what power will be at a certain CTL, almost no matter what makeup of training is. Many grand tours are planned like this for pro cyclists, in a broad simplistic term. Very, very interesting debate. Not something I ever thought I would engage with on a place like LRC!",

  {
    "msg": "Yeah I think the whole CTL thing in this case basically comes down to that we're dealing with runners who are mainly limited by bioenergetics, have a training framework that is sensible independent of CTL, and then use CTL to optimize that framework so that we are throwing as much training load at the bioenergetic limitation as possible. Obviously, there are still other aspects to training, and there's cases where the utility of CTL would start to break down (events shorter than 5k, athletes nearing their true limit of training and ability, etc). For a lot people some basic attention to stuff like strides, short hill sprints, and plyometrics is probably enough to pretty well handle the non-bioenergetic aspects of training that aren't reflected in CTL. Maybe a CTL/TSS concept could be refined by using an athlete's power curve instead of just FTP to calculate TSS. I'm not super clear on the math off the top of my head. I'd also still be cautious about using CTL or similar metrics as predictive of running performance in the same way as cycling. In cycling the bike handles a lot of aspects of biomechanical \"technique\" and it is not a plyometric exercise like running, so a generalized measure of training that reasonably captures bioenergetic fitness will correlate well with performance. With running our biomechanics at different paces and various musculoskeletal characteristics will create a lot of variance in how well our general bioenergetic fitness translates to actual performance, so CTL is likely less predictive.",
