Currently at low 15min 5k ability running 110-135km/week Got pretty clean data despite a couple mistakes, but better pacing and getting an extra data point below AeT/LT1 would have been helpful. To get LT1 we're looking for that first change in slope from baseline, so we need to establish baseline accurately. I'll also point out that the pace estimates I got from this test where exactly the same as those I had already been using based on a combination of VDOT and breathing guesstimates.

The third session is absolutely key, I made this mistake myself. This is the x factor without it seemingly looking like the traditional x factor. We've seen many people try short cuts or very low mileage/ time per week. Ultimately, the best method is 4x easy and 3x sub threshold. The ones it's really, really and I mean really working for, are these people. I've seen guys in the Strava group make it work with 6. Or 5-6 days + 1-2 days cross training. Having said that, what you are doing is not likely bad, for really low mileage and that's a very impressive time on not a lot. Especially if you consider sirpoc , who is the absolute gold standard for this, even more than KI at this point, was running 6-7 days and 5-6 hours a week at one point and was pretty slow at around 19 flat. But this didn't happen overnight, he even said himself, it's a long slow road and not a lot happened to his own times for maybe the first 6-8 weeks. A grind almost. Look at his runs over the past 18months Hardly missed a single day. Does the same thing absolutely. I guarantee you today we see 10*1k on his feed. That's how predictable and repeatable his training is. But also how much consistency and dedication you need to put in if you want this. The times are impressive but in my opinion the level of dedication and training focus is absolutely remarkable and is often overlooked here. Now he is probably in the top road runners in his country in the 40+ category. It's entirely possible he could become a national champion in 5k road this year if he enters, I hope he does.

Follow that as a general guide, you will almost certainly get better. Others have dialled in the final bits, to really take them to the next level.

    "msg": "I think of the hills or short track intervals, also referred to as the X-factor workout, as the workout that provides whatever needed stimuli isn't accomplished by all the easy volume and threshold work. What exactly that needed stimuli is here is specific to the development level and goals of the athlete. Part of it is target event -safe to say X-factor work is less relevant if you're priority races are 10km+, more important races 5km-. That being said, I'd say a larger part is the athletes development -what are someone's current performance limitations and what's the most effective way to address those. Threshold and easy volume are the meat and potatoes, X-factor is the sauce and seasoning. What a lot of people in this thread seem to be experiencing is that they don't have much need for anything beyond volume, threshold, and maybe some strides, or at least that they can still make good progress without much of anything resembling X-factor work. Most of us are running up against predominantly aerobic limitations so it makes sense to throw most/all of our workload towards addressing that limitation. Myself I don't really follow the \"method\" of this thread or the Bakken training exactly, but I do use a lot of the same guiding principles and my weekly structure looks somewhat \"Norwegian\". For background: formerly ran a lot and ran pretty fast in college several years, got really out of shape since then and now am a little over a year back into serious training again. Typical week I've done recently is ~130km, running twice/day 5x/week. All this is context to set up how I approach the X-factor day. Thanks to my talent and running history my innate speed/speed-endurance is pretty good, or at least relatively way better than my current aerobic fitness, but there are still some specific non-aerobic weaknesses I've noticed that I try to address. Among these are the skill of maintaining relaxed biomechanics while running 5k pace or faster, central max VO2/max HR ability, and just the mental toughness of being able to hurt. I've come up with two general workouts to address these aspects for myself. You'll notice these are not as hard/long as the X-factor sessions in the Bakken/Ingebrigtsen -given that I'm not a world-class 1500m/5000m runner and not training at their workload I don't need as big of a stimulus as those guys do. I do feel like this stuff has complemented the threshold running nicely and helps add some more fun to training. Funny enough though I'm now being forced into an all-sub-threshold scheme for a little while -I somehow got myself an intercostal muscle strain during some beer-fueled 4th-of-July swimming and currently can't breathe deep enough to run faster than MP without my chest feeling like it's going to explode. It will be an experiment to see how much X-factor work really matters.",

Similarly at the highest workload blood lactate level was 30% higher during HEAT than in the NEUTRAL environment (4.6 ± 1.0 vs 3.5 ± 0.6 mmol/ L; respectively, p<0.05). In the HEAT the rate of blood lactate accumulation increased and lactate threshold took place at 175 watts while it took place at 200 watt in the NEUTRAL trial. Due to the increase in heart rate in the HEAT, heart rate at lactate threshold was similar in the HEAT and NEUTRAL environments (150 ± 1 beats/min).” Unrelated to the above study, I’ve heard Dr Geoff Burns say that heat is the largest waste product in exercise, which from a physics standpoint makes a lot of sense and is an interesting way to think about it.",
