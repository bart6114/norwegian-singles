Based on that, the hypothesis was that LT% might improve with training too. And more for Elites as the train more. But this was not found for running. Your paper shared in post #2331, seems to indicate that training age might play a role, as well as muscle fiber topology.

I’m not. I also never said I use the Mader model for my training. I don’t. However, I am interested in the various training approaches circulating the running community, so make the effort to learn them. You know, so as not to be bamboozled by INSYCD, as you earlier suggested. Yes, if you have economy and VO2max values, you can use an optimization algorithm to fit vLamax. You’re making my point for me. Most of these studies are measuring VO2max, lactate, and economy anyway. So they could fit vLamax (they could obviously test it too and compare predicted vs observed) and using the experimental data, test how %VO2max at LT correlates with vLamax amongst the group. More simply, just observe how the lactate curve changes when VO2max is held constant and vLamax varies. Does that fit the experimental data of the subjects? Based on the model, that change alone is not far off the range of variation presented in the study, hence why I thought of that potential explanation and responded to lexel. Intuitively it would seem muscle fiber plays the bigger role but vLamax could very well be a reasonable proxy in lieu of muscle biopsy. I don’t know what field you’re in but simulations have been useful in my experience. If for no other reason than to establish a base knowledge and observe the mechanics of a complex system. Regarding lactate testing, I actually liked taking a sample after doing what Joe Vigil would call a 400m tag, but I wouldn’t suggest it because I know you’ll criticize it as being too long and dependent on aerobic metabolism to be of use in assessing purely anaerobic metabolism.

With experienced athletes i mean they do it for a longer time, several years. In the paper 'determinants of endurance in well trained athletes' (post #2331) most of the group L cyclists they had 1-3 years of cycling. That is ridiculous little experience and therefore adaptation time. You call them well trained, that is funny, so i have to reject also this paper for that purpose. As elite train more as recreational athletes and have the higher LTv, you would expect to see statistically higher LT% values for elite. This was not found for running (Stoa, 2020). One theory could be that muscle fibers can only partly transfered (over a longer period of time) i.e. from fast twitch IIa to slow twitch fibers and after several years of training its over, no more adaptation possible. Also what you do in your childhood, might play a significant role. There are individual LT% adaptations between athletes and because a marathoner or you have a higher LT% as the average, that does not prove anything. There is always the argument he is good at marathon because of his high LT% and not the other way around.

I simply decided to trust the rest of the testimonials in this magnificent thread and jump head first into the deep end with nothing more than a HR monitor , flat ground and sirpoc guide and help. I will do the obligatory shout-out to him, as he has answered question I have thrown at him on Strava direct message, no matter how dumb it is. I am for sure that he is sometimes sitting there wishing he never got involved in this thread! I will add the help he has given me is better than any coach. My expectations were not great, as I felt: 1. This goes against everything I was pre-conditioned to understand about running training. What does a guy someone who has only run for two years can teach me about running. 2. I was going to just do the basics. No lactate meter, no setting up my own guide based on paces and lactate curves. Just me, my Garmin, a HR strap I bought and the track/ flat ground. 3. I've seen better days. I'm in my 40s now and my last PB was 2015. The appeal of this was also the limited time aspect. I'm sure I am like others, but simply I do not have time for doubling. My first impressions were there is no way this can work. The sessions felt way, way . Not just a bit, incredibly easy. I remember finishing the first session of 3*10 mins almost chuckling to myself. Then I saw my HR and it was actually not far off LTHR by the end. Just under. Then kind of a light bulb went off. It's meant to feel like that and actually I had a very , very good workout , but the fact I kept myself a decent amount under LTHR meant I didn't really feel beat up . Was it a full threshold workout? No. But as sirpoc says in the guide. Even if you get 90% of the benefit, can you do this three times a week? Absolutely! This is the key. It's that extra workout. I've never been able to do three quality days + a long run a week. It was then difficult also to slow my easy pace down. That was also the key. That just means the day in between , the slower I brought that down the even easier it was to carry out the sub threshold workouts. I found the pace guides provided as well as the spreadsheet that was provided on Strava absolutely fantastic. I really didn't change much. As others have also said, not a lot happened initially. On about week 8 I did a 5k. I was very worried. In the warmup I did 2*400m at just under race pace and i felt really, really bad. There was surely no way I could even race at the pace I had 2 months prior? What a stupid training idea!!! I have gotten worse!! I was cursing sirpoc, this thread, everything. Feeling quite annoyed on the start line. Then, something weird happened. I felt awful again in the first 1km. Like my legs didn't understand this pace. But then, it's very odd. I just kept getting faster per KM. I ended up finishing in 18:10. 23 seconds faster than 2 months before. Just 20 seconds off my PB set when I was 35. Fast forward. Week 22. Almost two weeks ago now. I ran a HM. My PB was the aforementioned one from 2015, my last PB at any distance. I absolutely crushed it. Ran 1:19:34 to beat my PB by a huge margin and broke for my level, what I saw a mythical 80 mins mark. Fast forward again to last weekend 10 days when I was going to post, I figured I must be in really good shape so entered a very small 5k event. Ran 17:17 to crush my 5k PB. I just can't thank this thread enough. What does all this mean? Not a lot. I just thought I would share my thoughts and if anyone is skeptical like maybe I was, this I think really, really does work. Especially for older runners. But for everyone, it probably will provide the week by week, month by month consistency we probably mostly all lack. Do I understand the science behind it? Not sure I still fully do. Also not sure that matters. Hopefully the thread will inspire someone else. Have a great summer season everyone!",

Sirpoc method, exactly as laid out. E, ST, E, ST, E, ST, Long Easy. Long easy was just as laid out here, same sort of pace as the other easy days. Just longer. I started with 5.5 hours a week. I gradually built up to 7. Following the guide of no more than 25% time doing the sub threshold stuff in terms of a total % of time. The spreadsheet on Strava does all this for you. Hard2find also made a spreadsheet to plan future sessions and build, I used that for the final 10 weeks. Was awesome to use to plan that final build to 7 hours a week. I had two days off during the whole thing over 22 weeks as I was travelling those days. They are both easy days. I didn't need those days off at all. I didn't do anything extra - for real nothing - apart from copying sirpoc training from Strava or what he laid out here. No sperdwork, no 5k pace work, no hills. Nothing. I think that is probably the bit a lot of people get scared by. I know I was. Someone else said it. I felt like I was slower, but I was much, much faster in comparison to myself. Very odd sensation. I am sure for some people this won't work. But I believe in as has been discussed it's likely to work for the vast majority of us, simple because of the undeveloped nature of our aerobic capacity.

I've been using this method myself and with a fellow masters teammate since around December. He has responded way better than me and is probably running times he would have 5+ years ago. When you are in our 50s like us, that's quite incredible. I've had my best start to a year in 2-3 years.

The 5k national masters road championship is usually won in a low 15. It was 15:19 I think last year. I placed in the top 30, in something like a mid to high 16. Sirpoc would lap me in a 5k , or close to it, on the track. If he continues to progress at the same rate, there's a good chance he could win the road 5k masters national champs or at least get top 5. Must be all that 5k work I'm doing that helps me almost get lapped versus what he is doing. I have been running 20+ years since cross country in school on cold winter afternoons in the north of England. I've had dozens of coaches who think they know everything about running.

Also not sure if anyone has done periodized version of this training? Have thought for myself running mid distance with 5k max race distance could use this kind of training for summer/fall base then switch up to adding hills, strides in winter. Finally move to race pace stuff in spring. Maybe defeats purpose of long term gains but seems that threshold block from July-November could provide good aerobic base moving into faster stuff.

But my personal opinion is to avoid tweaking, at least at first, because so much of the beauty/point of the Sirpoc method comes from applying the tested structure: E Q E Q E Q E(LR), which is designed to maximize weekly load within a time constrained period in an infinitely repeatable way, while minimizing injury risk. If you want to deviate from this structure by condensing the schedule, then you're necessarily going to end up doing one of two things: 1. Increasing your load for a given day above what is recommended and introducing risk; or 2. Sacrificing weekly load by cutting back on either the LR or the Q or both Neither is optimal, so if you have the logistical ability to run 7 days a week, my advice is to just run the 7 days a week as prescribed. It's a great bang for your buck / value approach, which again is the entire point of this training. If you're scared about running 7 days because you've historically gotten hurt without a rest day, consider trying this system within prescribed paces for a week or two and see how you feel -- my prediction is you won't have any desire to rest on the seventh day. If you logistically can't run 7 days and need to chop something, in the absence of more info I'd probably cut out the long run and keep a full third Q session as programmed. Eventually once you know the system and your limits you can try to work in more volume onto the E days to open up more intervals on the Q days. But again, the long run is part of this method's special sauce, both in terms of benefits produced in isolation and also in terms of its supportive ability to unlock additional intervals. So if you can keep it, I'd do that.",
