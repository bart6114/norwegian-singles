    "msg": "I assumed that most of us engaging in this discussion do have an appreciation for the nuance of these metrics, LT included. The two tests I see most often used and cited (but not saying these are the only and best ones) are either 1200m intervals on the track or 3 minute intervals on the treadmill. I’ve used both myself, but have also collected readings when doing tempo intervals, VO2 Max intervals, and 60-90 second hill repeats. I may have also poked myself after a few time trials, I’d have to check my data. All of that is to say, I was aware that what I was gathering was unique to me (just as spiroc stated about TSS and CTL values) and not necessarily generalizable to others without standardizing it. I’ve seen it discussed before that if the intensity was increased in smaller steps, the lactate curve would likely be a continuous exponential function that could be fitted for each athlete specifically of course. I think the same would hold true that if you extended each interval in duration, past a certain intensity level, the lactate readings would rise if you went long enough. This to me, is why standardizing is helpful, as it gives a consistent way to report data and then extrapolate for others to use and experiment with. I think we appreciate that most running metrics are multi-variate, so far as what is contributing to the output being achieved. I’d suggest that blood lactate isn’t only intensity and time dependent but also physiological in the sense of the athletes fiber make up. Meaning, I can’t seem to generate high values of lactate, relatively speaking. I’m VERY, seemingly, slow twitch dominant as well and from the data I’ve seen, this seems to perhaps be a characteristic of runners like myself. As opposed to the ones who are more middle distance oriented and can generate higher relative lactate values. Similar to heart rate, I thought of the lactate readings as 1) a source for some new data and 2) a different way to control effort and, perhaps, quantitatively know I wasn’t overdoing it in workouts. Having been there, done that. I think it’s helpful, but certainly not something that’s going to turn me into a world beater, as that’s not seemingly in my genetics. However, like everyone, I do have a maximum potential, so it’s interesting to try different approaches in the quest to reach that point and feel like I'm pursuing that purposefully and productively.",

    "msg": "Anecdotally and to the point about blood lactate varying with intensity, but also duration at that intensity. It’s very similar for HR. I found when doing 1K-4K intervals for a total volume of 12K, my average HR on these intervals was near the HR I averaged in the marathon. However, my pace on these intervals was usually at or slightly slower than half marathon pace. I of course knew that when racing, the fact that it is continuous and a distance greater than the workout volume, my pace to HR was not going to match what I was doing in my workouts. In fact, I did a 18 mile tempo run at nearly the same pace I averaged for the marathon at an average HR of 155 bpm (80% HR_Max), in the marathon I averaged 163 bpm (84% HR_Max). Maybe I shouldn’t have tapered at all for that race? LOL. For reference, when I ran the half marathons, my HR averaged 91% Max_HR. I never approached this effort in my tempo interval sessions though (for the average of the interval). I was running high volume during this time, 10.5-11.5 hours per week most weeks and do feel the higher general volume contributes to the HR values staying lower. When I’m not running as much volume, say around 7.5-8.0 hours per week, my heart rate on tempo interval sessions will rise higher to about 90% HR_Max. I think this is pretty established though that the fitter you are aerobically, the harder it is to approach that higher HR in sessions, since it requires a more intense pace if the duration is not sufficiently long enough. Conversely, in a race, you can hold a higher percent of HR_Max since you are more aerobically fit.",

The paces are kind of irrelevant, they just are to give an idea of what speeds I run for me, to keep my mmol in the desired range at a maximum of just below threshold or even a little under that. I just call it sub threshold in the sense it is pushing up my lactate from below, much like the success I had whilst cycling. I mean the best tool would be a real time lactate meter, I hear that actually one of Tadej Pogacar's coaches is very close to a prototype. The paces are all different of course, but with different lengths with the rests, when I spent a month or so testing them, they all got me to around about the same range of lactate. Plus it's nice to have some practises at different velocities and speeds. The training is boring enough as it is. But I would guess you could just stick to one set, if you really wanted to. Maybe Kristoffer is training for something longer again, as he much favours heavily the 3k repeats. Now I have new data and the fact I've gotten fitter based on a quicker 10k, relative to my 5k, I'll adjust my actual paces to back within the parameters I set. As this thread is still quite active I have a lactate meter I can borrow again and I'll buy some test strips and see. So I'll raise the actual pace for say 1k, but leave it relative to my 15 k pace and I *should* see the same sort of lactate levels, within the margins of error that is good enough for me.",

    "msg": "We ultimately train to race, so our race performance is the ultimate predictor of, well, our race performance LOL. I get what Lexel is saying in regard to having a standard pace that is then reported as a percentage of when structuring workouts. I think that has seemingly been what many tried to do with LT (defined as 60 minute race pace). I know Tinman has his reasons both bioenergetic and statistical that he thinks CV is better than LT (perhaps some of those are promotional too though), but depending on your physiological make up and race distance you’re training for, CV could be far off from your race pace say if you run the marathon as opposed to if you are racing 5km to 10km. So if you used LT (60 minute race pace) that would be closer to half marathon and marathon race pace and thus would likely come with a narrower window of predictive error. Point being, in either scenario, it’s an arbitrary lab value. As I’ve said before, we don’t seem to have a true understanding of the mechanism that underlines the variety of adaptions we see to a variety of athletes using a variety of training philosophies. No one seems to be able to know that CV is a good predictor of 5km performance simply because it is closer as a percentage, and thus physiological demand, to 5km race pace any more than because it holds some deeper physiological influence. We know the further up in distance you go, say from 5km to the marathon, the more overall volume contributes. Yes you can run good predictor workouts and have good lab metrics but that’s a lot different than running an actual race. I know from personal experience that I can run my 5 km best off about 7.5 hours per week (and possibly my 10km best too). But I fall off slightly for half and even more for full. If I reach 9.5 in singles, that’s basically me at my best for the half and full (correlates to what Lydiard suggested too btw). However, of interest, is that I’m no faster over 5km with that added volume and only marginally better at 10km, to the point it could just be some random factor on the day of the races/tests I’ve done. I think of this as an “adaptive threshold”. Whether it’s my body being able to only absorb so much or physically just not being able to run any faster than a certain percentage of say my 400m speed, is a curious discussion, but the reality of my performance doesn’t change. Not to belabor this point, but Daniels has said on various occasions that there is no physiological difference in training at marathon pace than at your easy pace, seemingly implying that you should stick to what he defines as T pace if you want to improve your LT. However, if I try to run Daniels T pace spot on, I always feel like I’m overreaching and can only handle one of those workouts a week and no more than 10km volume. However, if I slow down by just 4-8 seconds per 1600m, I can do 12km in volume, twice per week, and see race performance improvements relative to previous races where I did follow a Daniels approach. I also notice I always seem to over perform what my workouts would “predict”. I’m always slower in workouts than what race performances and calculators say I should be.",

Im sure we all have stories from our past where our ego completely ran the show. Called being young mostly. To the Daniels point, i couldnt disagree with that more. Marathon pace for runners is essentially Zone 2/LT1 work. I think at this point there is a mountain of evidence that show very distinct adaptations and advantages to running in Zone 2 vs running Easy. Take two runners for instance in a summer build up to fall XC. One runner does only E runs according to Daniels and strides. Another runner does a variation with 3-4 days a week with higher Aerobic/Zone 2/LT1 work. Im putting my money on the Zone 2 runner to really be able to springboard into the harder work and racing in the fall I'd say this system works great when fueling and fat burning are not a higher consideration, basically 1500-HM (depending on how long you are on your feet for the HM). WHen you are talking full Marathon, you really need to think about the demands of that event, and the other considerations and adaptations youll need for 2:20-4:00 of work. There you definitely need the longer runs and you definitely need the LT1/Zone2 work to juice your fat burning capacity and spare as much glycogen as possible for as long as you possibly can to not bonk. In the Half, depending on how long it takes, same considerations. You really have to think about the limiting factors in the event. Like people keep popping in with previously \"oh you need VO2 work\". Id guess 98% of people running 5k-HM, their VO2 Max is not their biggest limiting factor to running faster, which is the goal here as you have stated.

    "msg": "I feel like what this thread is really uncovering is getting to the bottom of what training really is. We should all be individualizing more. There are certain shortcuts or benchmarks people use as a guide for how to train which are really quite false and bad but are very common: 1.) Using a race performance to modify training. It should be done in certain ways but not in other ways. Where this goes wrong is when the race performance is good and people use this as a reason to modify their training. Isn't that just crazy? Good races are often used as justification to increase training intensity or volume, like \"I need to update my training paces according to this new performance\" or \"I have achieved all the improvement I can get out of this training volume and now I need to increase it if I want to continue to improve.\" Both ideas are insane! But they are so common. If you have a good race, that is an indication that your training is effective as it is! Don't change it! It's only when you have a bad race that you might say \"I'm overtraining\" or if you have plateaued then you might say \"I'm undertraining.\" If you have a good race, your training is effective, don't significantly change it! Run the same volume at the same perceived effort. Paces and mileage will naturally increase without conscious effort. Keep doing that until improvements stop coming, and only then do you intervene. 2.) Comparing your training to someone else's. This is also crazy, especially when you tie it in to comparing your races and your training to someone else's races and training. Our ability to train is way too individualized, just like our ability to race. One untrained person can run a 17:00 5k while another runs a 23:00 5k. One untrained person can do training load X while another untrained person can do training load 2*X. It can really vary by that much such that it's not even close. And the two things (our natural ability to race and our natural ability to train) aren't related. The 17:00 5k runner might be that much faster in the 5k but they cannot handle anywhere near as big a training load as a slower 5k runner. In fact I'd guess that they're probably inversely related: the faster you can run with less training, the lighter your training should be and the more cautious you should be about increasing it. 3a.) Key workouts. People do \"indicator workouts\" or \"race simulator workouts\" which are totally unnecessary and completely break the optimization of training (in the sense that the amount of time they take to recover from is not worth the benefit they're providing). RACES are the thing which we try our hardest in and break the optimization of training to do. If you want to do hard efforts, then do a race! Don't race in training! People need to have confidence that their training is effective. Jakob has talked about this -- he doesn't need to prove anything to himself in a workout. He's 100% sure that the training he's doing is effective. His hardest efforts are reserved for races, where they matter. All the rest of his effort is used for optimal training, which doesn't involve maximum efforts. 3b.) Peak weeks and \"down weeks\". This is so high risk and is there really a reward? You're essentially overtraining on purpose. What if you don't fully recover? Your race performance will be ruined. What if you would've gained more fitness by just having two normal weeks? Marathoners will increase and increase their mileage and then have a huge marathon pace long run \"on tired legs\" for the peak of their training. Maybe, MAYBE, designing your training cycle with this kind of thing is optimal. But SO many people mess it up and it is absolutely not necessary. 99.9% of runners do not need to mess with this concept at all. Not every training week should be identical in nature (there's some training that's better done far away from your race and some that's better done closer to your race) but no one should be overtraining on purpose, even if they're scheduling extra recovery. My main takeaway from this thread is that having 3 quality days a week and running really truly easy on the other 4 days is a very effective foolproof template that everyone should try to follow. And in order to follow it, the quality days have to be easy enough to recover from that you actually recover and can sustain the training. And in order to do that, the easiest type of workout that you can do which is still effective is these easy threshold intervals, starting with as small a volume as you need to sustain it and building up to what Jakob does as a maximum volume. These sessions are what you can do on the days which precede 1 easy day. What you do for the 3rd quality day of the week, which precedes 2 easy days, can be a little more difficult and should cover a different aspect of physiological development (like doing hills / speed, or for a marathoner, a long run with some kind of tempo / fartlek). So as someone else mentioned, trial-and-error is very likely the best thing an individual can do. Doing some kind of fitness test, max heart rate test, monitoring heart rate or monitoring lactate, etc etc, should just give someone a starting point. And then it should be individual trial-and-error: can I do my 3 sessions a week indefinitely? Am I really staying on top of my recovery? That should be the top priority. Make it easy enough so that's a confident \"yes\". After that, you occasionally race. If your performances are improving, then change nothing (except what naturally changes by keeping the same perceived effort). If they plateau, then think about how you want to increase the stimulus so you can continue to improve: maybe your paces have slacked off a bit and should increase, or maybe you should increase volume a bit. Either way, make a small incremental change, make sure the training is still indefinitely sustainable, and race again in a few months. There's NO NEED to continuously compare your journey to anyone else's or to refer to a chart or any physiological measurements or anything. I understand that doing so has been massively helpful for Jakob and Gjert says it's essential, but they're attempting to reach absolutely 100% of Jakob's potential, setting literal world records. And copying them might not even work for our own physiologies. They've made no attempt to provide a universal blueprint that will work for any physiology. We should guide our own journeys. Start somewhere -- err on the side of the training being too easy -- and see if you improve or not. Get an idea for what you can handle and increase it only if necessary. Anyway, that's my takeaway. I personally have been the guy who runs relatively fast on little training, who has then taken cues from other peoples training (and not just on my own in some misguided and incorrect fashion -- I've received individualized training from coaches who have coached elites, and from elites who have gotten into coaching) in an attempt to get more serious and perhaps graduate from \"sub-elite\" to \"elite\", and then just ended up overtraining over and over and over again. If that rings a bell, I think this is a good lesson to learn. If that's not you, maybe my perspective isn't helpful. I'm too old now to ever be elite (well, there's always the masters category) but finding good training late in life is still a great gift, better late than never. I respect the people who are keen on comparing training and races in order to build general knowledge and understanding. It's an essential part of all of this. It's a worthy project and could eventually lead to comparisons actually being more useful than they are now. But for an individual just managing their own training, my strong opinion as someone who has been led astray so many times, is to use it as a starting point and then live in your own individual world. PS: I have a pet theory that a lot of sub-elites and low tier elites have been overtraining their whole lives, but not so bad that they don't improve, so they just keep doing it their whole careers. Then at some point they stop improving and they cannot possibly train any harder, so they think \"Well I hit my genetic peak. This is it.\" But they're wrong -- they could've hit a higher peak by training lighter along the way. Some of us can't improve while overtraining but I think a lot of people can and then they develop a totally warped idea about the relationship between training and performance, and that trickles down and permeates to everyone else, creating all kinds of false ideas about what kind of training is necessary to achieve a certain performance. I base this on the fact that (like I said earlier) people keep increasing their training loads before they plateau. They have so much fear about \"wasting\" a season of training by undertraining that they constantly err on the side of overtraining, but not so much that it's catastrophic, and then they end up spending their whole careers slightly overtraining, never actually training optimally. They burn out and/or plateau before they accumulate as many years of effective training (before getting too old and declining) as they could have.",

Because I had little expectation for each workout (which was essentially a steady state run 8-10 miles) I would just go whatever pace my body felt like on that day. Some days were quick 5:10 pace, other days no so much 5:40 pace...but it did not bother me either way. = the problem for me was after that 1 great year, I kept trying to replicate what had worked and got fairly good again a few times, but never the same. = my thinking is the base years in college allowed me to maximize training on low mileage, but I needed to go to the base training for a while to get results again (of low mileage). So my conclusion is low mileage training works, high mileage training work, high before low works best of all. too high expectations does not work trying to copy someone else's workouts does not work",

The guy has clearly stated he's looking to get to 2.5-3.5 mmol and he's tested this. There is a ton of ways he can get to that, almost unlimited combinations of reps and paces. What that % of critical velocity is almost irrelevant to the thread and conversation. You keep bringing it up just doesn't make any sense. Obviously pace is higher, the shorter the reps. I do much longer reps mainly because the strips are expensive. So I have found 3x13 mins works great for me, at marathon pace. But I could get exactly the same response though from the lactate I am looking for, with 9x4 mins, for a completely different pace. The actual pace would be much different BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER. The different paces get you running and practicing I guess at different speeds, but the response it lactate you are eliciting from the body is the same. This thread is about getting as much training you can do, sub threshold. That's it. Nothing more. I personally think this is the best way to train and I've had great results myself. The pace is totally irrelevant. Maybe it shouldn't be mentioned. I think maybe it's confusing for people to read Spoc84 posts, as awesome as they are how he laid out the paces. They are not for you.

It feels sustainable, with people seemingly doing this all year round and 2. Really nobody has mentioned feeling tired or it breaking them down and feeling injured . That is huge. I don't think I've read many long threads on letsrun where it's been sustainable, it's not a miracle quick fix then you break down but most of all people are actually getting faster. Does anyone have a theory as to why? Is it simply the recovery is easier + the lack of vo2 max stuff?

I don't think spoc, Hard2find, shirtboy, or others pretend to be scientists, but there's been plenty of citation of guys who are. There is no backing off the quicker stuff. He doesn't do any apart from race. Again, it's not just a case of how most training works, where it's time to lay off the vo2 max stuff in training - there isn't any. At all.

Many of the best coaches are not academically trained in exercise science and it hasn't stopped them from developing their approaches and sharing that with others. Regarding including VO2Max intervals or anything faster than LT (60 min race pace). I am not in line with sirpoc on that. I will include OCCASSIONAL workouts where I am running 5k-10k pace for 800m-1600m intervals, but this is usually when a few weeks out from a 5k-10k race and I have found that just 2-3 sessions are needed. Regarding doing the threshold workouts, I think a way that people can conceptualize them is as follows. If you think of doing strides, say 100m strides at 1500m pace, in that 100m you build up very little, if any, significant lactate above your baseline, even though you’re running at 1500m speed. So, if the goal is to keep your blood lactate below your 60 min threshold level, say 3.5-4.0 mmol, you could construct a variety of workouts at paces faster than LT but done in short enough intervals and with proper recovery where your blood lactate never rises above your threshold but you accumulated a high volume of work at a speed faster than it. I personally don’t take this approach as I find running at or slightly slower than LT is more productive for me, since I’m more 10k to marathon focused. However, it’s an idea to play around with for some, perhaps. Also, in the least matter of fact tone possible, correct night owl!, I’m not a physiologist, but I am actually a scientist LOL",

I didn't invent this training, I just laid it out in a way I think is probably understandable and doable, to an extent, even without a lactate meter. There will be guesswork involved, but for a hobby jogger I think you can get it good enough. For an elite, or sub elite, probably a little too much unknowns that I would only do it with a meter. But for 90+% of us, the way I laid out I think will yield good results. I combined how I trained as a cyclist to a pretty high level, to what I saw the older Ingebrigtsten brother doing. I didn't just make this up on the top of my head, it's a hybrid of stuff I've picked up over the years or just blatantly stolen, like how I came to the rep lengths for running. I'm 39, almost 40. I'm 173cm and 67kg. Have been that weight since lockdown +-1kg, no change. I know I could lose weight. Peak cycling I was 60kg, sometimes slightly less. But I like beer, pizza and McDonald's too much ha ha My local parkrun course has 3 dead turns and a long out and back stretch on gravel, if I can do sub 17 on this I'll be very happy. That's really my only training goal. The all time course record is a low 16 I think. I got my gun time for the 10k, was 35:41. So I would be quite happy with sub 35 maybe at some point as well as a target. And I always do 3 sessions a week, no matter what. The third session is replaced on the Saturday by parkrun, if I do it. I added it up how often I did them the other day in post. Sunday my first ever 10k, was the session and did the rest of the week normal. I just actually had a rare occasion an extra easy day in a row before the 10k.

I think there's quite a few people here who can help with different things, but I can definitely help with this. I don't use runalyze, but I hugely recommend either Golden Cheetah for the PC version or use intervals icu for mobile (it's browser based, but works fantastic in mobile brave on my android). This IMO will open things up to what is happening in your training. You'll start to see patterns and understand why you stagnate or when it's time to just do things like I suggested, like time to add on 5 mins here and there to easy runs before you add more reps. Intervals will also give you a visualisation and breakdown each week of your time in zone breakdown. This is hugely valuable. You can customise that breakdown in a number of ways. I would suggest using time in zone, pace as the main metric, with heart rate as back up and also if you have a reliable and more modern watch, select in the pace settings in intervals icu , gradient adjusted pace. You can use HR, I don't think it matters too much, you will see slightly different numbers. For me, it evens out (roughly) But the TSS per session seems slightly less for me in the easy runs by HR and slightly more in the workout sessions, than by pace. Overall, I mentioned the other day I have re evaluated the last few hundred runs and basically it ended up the same. Just stick to one though. Once you have picked , just stay with it. Obviously pace isn't as good as a power meter in cycling, which is the ultimate tool , but I can still use the PMC (it's under the fitness tab in intervals, but the same thing) to index my current fitness) roughly to my training load. The main takeaway in basic terms for me, I could only make it to maybe around a CTL (FITNESS score in intervals icu) of 50, training a more traditional running approach, on around 6.5-7 hours a week. It was only as I started to train like this for the same hours, which made my CTL increase, for no more hours. So obviously I could experiment with how to push the envelope and understand why I have gotten faster. You mention fatigue, FWIW, the fatigue/tsb score in general I've found quite accurate over the years. I once was cycling and really felt terrible from a training block, had a TSB of like -50. Over the years in cycling it gave me a pretty good idea of where I was at. I could train hard still on about -15 to -20 ish. So for me it was a good metric to use, as again I could index that score and use it for patterns over time. It was as good as telling me when I needed a break as my body. My issue was always I didn't want to believe my body, I was weak and could just push through. The numbers reigned me in. One more thing, training like this for running, you don't need to worry about this too much. I've never accumulated a fatigue score over -10, in intervals icu. That's primarily because this is so controlled, it's basically the same thing every week or at worst ramp it up a tiny bit. Cycling is a bit more variable, you might do some crazy 7 hours ride , it feels easy, but actually that load is huge under the hood and has trashed you in retrospect, more than your body initially tells you. You'd probably find this to be the case in running. That I could easy go out and run 75% of MHR for my long run, it might feel OK as an individual run in isolation, but actually if that becomes the easy standard over time, it will then grind you down (not horrifically I guess) but more than you realise. Just make sure you are 100% sure you know your threshold pace to begin with and that you know your LTHR. Also, keep those updated the second you clearly know you have improved, through a face or time trial or whatever you benchmarks are likely to be. Right, I was going to also post and bore everyone with what happened yesterday , as I got my wallet, bought some more lactate strips . Can't believe how expensive they have gotten 😭😂😂.",

It's ramps up very quickly and when I played around and deliberately messed up and went too hard on the final interval once, HR was not hugely over LTHR but lactate was really high. I mentioned, I could really feel that 7-8 mins in my legs the next day in a way that was quite shocking, compared to normal. It's why I would encourage people to be extra cautious to not go over, if you are going to want to do this every other day. As per my example, whilst I wasn't testing I was probably mid 2 mmol possibly even around 2.1-2 the last couple of weeks, based on post workout analysis of heart rate - but was still getting fitter to allow myself to push up from below . Seems what we have seen is very similar, it shows there are definitely patterns there to learn from. As I've said before, what one persons pace is to get to the desired mmol, might be different to someone else's. The ones I posted now, way back on page 1, appear to be transferable now to the next level of fitness for me. But that doesn't mean they always will, or will even work as a starting point for the next person. It's why I'm not really worried too much about CV or its meaning. I just do what I can go get to that nice range you see on the meter 😊 That doesn't mean pace zones and guides won't work, as there is a good margin for error , especially the range under threshold. Like I've said, I haven't use a meter for months. But , I'll make it clear for the final (or not time ha ha) a lactate meter will give you the absolute best results.",
