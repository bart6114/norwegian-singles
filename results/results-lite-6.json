It's nonsense to think that all you need is just threshold in your low mileage schedule. 2. Who trains low mileage, does it consciously.

I'm not saying we should be at these extremes, running should be more accessible - but you can gain an advantage at any sub elite or hobby jogger level I feel if you do work to maximise your training load. The whole point of this thread and then the vast amount of fantastic contributors towards it, is to make thinking hobby joggers can improve nearer to their maximum potential. I can only speak for me (although others have clearly shared their positive experiences) but worrying about all this has improved my 5k to level I quite happy with, having been at a point or stagnation that was really disappointing. If you offered most people a 7.5% improvement in performance over a year after the previous year or so of just maintaining,I think they would take it, no? Hobby jogger or not and yes even Parkrunners! I just wouldn't have got that increase in performance had I kept doing what I was doing - which was not worry too much and just follow the standard template, some tempo, some vo2, some moderate runs etc. So I think it matters.

I recognize the limitations physiologists can face in regard to their research, but that is not data that warrants absolute conclusiveness, in a true scientific sense. If anything, I think it demonstrates how we should be more careful in assigning take away messages from research to apply in our training.

There is no question that most of us just can't reach the optimum with threshold/sub threshold alone. To me, typical low mileage is a weekly volume of 20-45 miles. At the latest from 50-60 miles the term \"low mileage\" loses its meaning. I would like to give an example. In the thread \"Getting the most out of lower mileage\" here at LRC a \"jerrry\" writes that he achieved his PR's (8k 23:45, 10k sub 30, 20k 1:03) as follows, quote: \"Sun - Long run day (usually after a race so a comfortable pace of 6:00 for 10-15 miles). Tues - Long tempo day (up to 12 miles) 5:30 or faster Thur - i call this my pre-meet workout - a short steady state of 3 miles (6:00, 5:40, 5:20) then 1 fast mile sub 4:30...then steady for another 2 miles to finish. Sat - race day (any where from 2M - 1/2 marathon).\" Besides a lot of threshold and sub-threshold, it's the weekly races and also the Thursday workout that have obviously helped him to achieve his lifetime PR's. Consciously he trained only 4 days/week to a) optimize recovery and b) minimize risk of injury and c) train exclusively all quality. This includes really fast stuff. That's the idea behind low mileage training. It may be that there are a few runners who reach their personal best without race pace stuff during the training, but that is statistically and training-scientifically not the majority and certainly not for distances under 5k.",

The whole point is to maximise the load, you are correct. In simple terms, I believe you can measure your overall training load/stress via a number of repeatable and consistent metrics . In pure simplistic terms - my finding as a general rule of thumb is that by creating the highest total training load via TSS, will result in increased fitness and performance. ( I've got quite in depth pages back that I have managed to index training load/CTL over time to my own performance ).This is from cycling mostly but now also running for me over the past year. KI is doing something very similar I believe. In this case, if you believe in this, there's less value in terms of classic 5k and below pace work. You can't do as much of it, it doesn't create as much load and in my experience you are more likely to get injured/tired/fatigued on these days. Whereas training at just below threshold, is pretty sustainable over a long period of time. Many people have mentioned the word boring here. It is very boring. So boring in fact, sometimes it's really hard to stick to it. But if you have the discipline, the benefits outweigh the negatives if your overall goal is to get faster.

This is the same results practically I see in my own training and coaching . Imagine my horror to read this haha. I‚Äôm only replying because I would never want to be associated with the claim that training at 100% vVO2Max is what I suggested. I think the judicious insertion of sessions at about 97% of vVO2Max (Daniels I pace) is definitely useful, I‚Äôve said that. The majority of my workouts though are at about 94%-100% of Daniels T pace. I am a fan of his general approach. I just don‚Äôt adhere strictly to his T pace, more so run in the range of M pace to T pace for sessions. Which, if you read his second edition, he does include the idea that tempo runs in the 20-60 minute range slow from T pace to M pace as you approach 60 minutes.",

Again if you want to go to a lab and learn your threshold is at 86.1% vo2max and you have a lactate of 4.1mmol, great. Or just use your 60 min race time and be close enough. And you are missing the point. Pros monitor precisely so they don't over train. For Low mileage runners (i.e. all those people running <40 mpw) this isn't an issue. They aren't running 10*1ks or doing 2 hours runs. They don't come close to the training And unrelated the vvo2 type running is to some extent what we are avoiding.

    "msg": "I certainly have no idea what this thread is about at this point (haha), but I‚Äôve enjoyed the exchange. I think sirpoc‚Äôs approach is probably what most people associate as the emphasis of this thread? There have been a few of us to suggest that if the Norwegian approach is just broadly considered more emphasis on a range of threshold paces for workouts, as opposed to just LT or the ‚Äútraditional‚Äù approach of one LT and one VO2Max session per week, that has proved more sustainable and beneficial performance wise. Obviously, this is nothing novel, but I don‚Äôt think anyone has made that claim? I agree that unless carried out in a very controlled manner, it‚Äôs hard to know if our improvements come from specific changes in training versus the accumulation of training benefits from consistency, accrual over past seasons, maturation, etc. However, and I can only speak for myself, when I have shifted to a more traditional approach (one LT session and one VO2Max session per week), I see a drop off in performance and feel burned out. I personally would prefer the traditional approach, both for the aesthetic appeal of how it looks on the calendar and the variety in workouts. One long run, one tempo run, one interval session. That has a nice feel to it. However, it just hasn‚Äôt proven as beneficial for me as one long run and two tempo sessions at slower than LT, with the occasional VO2Max session, in general. Regarding your suggestion on studying responses to training, there has been no shortage of such studies in the research literature. Peter Snell, Olympic gold medalist, who is a physiologist performed a study where I believe the group of runners he used ran easy for 6 weeks and then split into two groups, one which ran two interval sessions per week consisting of 200m-400m for a total of about 4800m and another which ran two tempo runs per week of 30 minutes each. The other runs were all easy. They did this for 10 weeks. I can‚Äôt recall what the specific paces were, nor can I find the exact study to check it, but an 800m and 10km test were performed at the end of the easy running phase and then again at the end of the workout phase. At both the 800m and 10km, the interval trained group improved more on average. This was a surprise as tempo runs should have been more beneficial for the 10km. I remember reading this study and testing it on myself, although slightly modified. I did 6 weeks of just easy volume, 6*60 minutes and 1*90 minutes, then 6 weeks of two 30 minute tempos, then 6 weeks of two 15 minute intervals. During this experiment I maintained a 90 minute long run and 60 minutes easy on the other days. I did my time trials on the track and used a 1600m and 10,000m. I had the opposite result as Snell‚Äôs experiment, I ran both the 1600m and 10,000m slower after the intervals than I did after the tempos. Training and performance is quite the perplexing experiment haha",

Summer is normally when I‚Äôll play around with different approaches and structures, so that‚Äôs what I settled on out of curiosity. The initial 6 weeks of easy running was a way to equalize things, so to speak. Instead of going in with a huge base of mileage, I kept the hours constant to better assess the effectiveness. Plus, the volume is staying the same but the change in stimulus is coming from only the intensity of the two workout days and not from a shift in volume and intensity. Snell, I believe, had the runners maintain their volume as well. Whether or not he‚Äôd done that in his study, my intention was not to build a huge base and then cut volume significantly when doing intervals. I‚Äôve tried that approach and the results were even more atroscious. Also I think you‚Äôre confused? I did do intervals, twice per week, that totaled 15 minutes per session. I used 10*1.5min and 5*3min. So, 6 weeks easy, 6 weeks with 2 tempo sessions, 6 weeks with 2 interval sessions. If I had done the intervals before the tempos, one could say, ‚ÄúWell the intervals helped the tempos and you still had the benefit of them when you ran your time trials.‚Äù In this scenario, since the intervals were considered to be superior to the tempos, the faster time trial results should have come after the intervals, not the tempos.

I was otherwise in around the 2.5-3 ish range. What I really felt was it in my legs the next day, quite shockingly in fact for what was only a relatively short amount of time. The amount of fatigue is totally out of proportion to what seems like only a little bit of extra pace. It's why I agree 10 seconds here makes a huge amount of difference. Once you get up in that high ish range just under LT state, it's a real balancing act to make sure you stay in that zone. It's why as boring (yet again) I sound, I would much prefer someone to run slightly too slow and pace on the cautious side, that to push the limits where the risk reward just isn't worth it. Even if you lactate is only 2.0 mmol or just above as a random example , you are still going to be getting a huge amount and % of the benefit as if you are at say 3.3 mmol, to pick another arbitratory point as the example. But the issue is say you are regularly hitting the 4+ range. There's no way anyone could handle this 3x a week on maybe 7 hours like me, for almost a year. The 4+ might be giving you a a slightly higher TSS per session , but the value just isn't there if you can only do it twice a week instead of three times.

Plus, this thread clearly loves data and detail, so why let those who disagree disrupt the content of our exchange. On that topic, and for those who say pace doesn‚Äôt matter (within a limit of course), look at a well plotted lactate curve where blood lactate is plotted as a function of speed. Take a small unit change in pace, say 5 seconds per kilometer, so just 2 seconds per 400m. When you‚Äôre well below LT1 you can make many unit increases and have little to no change in lactate, but then you reach that LT1 point and that same unit change leads to a large change in lactate. Get to that LT2 point (or slightly beyond) and that one unit change results in a massive spike in lactate. That is all happening in a relatively narrow window (LT1 to LT2) compared to the range of paces leading up to that threshold. The bioenergetics of what‚Äôs happening when you are in that range is very interesting and also, as sirpoc pointed out, quite delicate. You can literally pick up the pace by just 1-2 seconds per 400m and be imposing a much greater stress on your body, bioenergetically speaking, when you are at your LT2. Anyone who has had lactate testing done or uses/has used a meter would, I think, definitely have an appreciation for this, in the sense of relating the feeling to the numbers. It‚Äôs rather fascinating. As far as it changing how we train and what workouts to do, I think that‚Äôs up to the individual to use that information as they want. Some embrace it, some discard it.

This is the really good thing about training sub T, there's a window probably right down to where you are asking about in marathon pace, to collect a lot of the benefits. Which is why people doing doubles will often start the day with a session at somewhere around this pace to try and hit around this lactate.

I would say right, today run 5x7 mins at HM pace + 2 seconds per KM and he would be like \"it was awesome! I felt amazing so the last two reps I was around hour pace!!\" As if I would be impressed. He just didn't listen that he was burning himself out really quick. Within a few weeks he was wrecked as he was doing stuff like this every session. The same on 10x1k would end up around 10k pace. Going back to Jiggys post, you can see quite quickly how much lactate would have been building up session on session towards the end, which, just isn't sustainable long term for 3x a week.",

But you got better: HR got lower and also lactate at 16.3kph is better with the second one. I don't use either the avg HR, nor the max HR during a ramp protocol, i use the avg HR of the last minute of a ramp based on experience, because HR needs some time to settle, and one single HR spike is not of interest, which would influence a max level. I full agree with other posters that the intensity matters. It is not the same to train at 2mmoler or 4mmoler as an example. I just had a 8 week training period, were i did easy and so called sweetspot Q sessions (around 90%FTP, 2x/week, around 85%CV) on the bike, resulting in lactate levels of 2.5-3.0mmol.

I did a few 400's sessions outdoors with 30 second rest in which I went faster than my HM pace (but also slower at times, due to the harsh humid summer I'm in). Moreover, I went ahead and did my first VO2 Max work yesterday, after not having done any such work since March. I wanted to do so for two reasons: 1) Sharpen up for a local 5K that I might do next week. 2) Test the system and just introduce some variety to the stress stimulus I've been subjecting myself to. So I set out to run a classic 5x1K in the evening. It is still very hot over here, but was not overly humid. It was 32.8 degrees Celsius with a relative humidity of 56% yielding a real feel of only 38.3 degrees Celsius (I say only because we can get days with a real feel of 50-55 degrees Celsius, so yeah). Having woken up with a somehow tight chest and given the conditions, I thought I'd be satisfied with hitting 3:30/km pace, or anything around that. I split the first rep in 3:20.3, and just started laughing out loud just as I did when I watched Jakob waving to the crowd during the semi final the other day. That first rep felt incredibly easy that I thought there must be something wrong. After a 400m jog recovery, I continued. Well here are the splits for the second, third and fourth kilometers: 3:21.5 3:22.1 3:23.9 Things did get tough for the last reps, and I mentally quit on the fifth last rep after 0.5 km which was also at 3:21/km pace. HR maxed out at 198 bpm which is 98% of Max HR for me. It was hot, I was solo, I had done weight training and 4 km easy in the morning before work, and I still managed to run faster than I used to during the winter when I had company for some of the workouts. Sure, I have been running more mileage lately, but that can't be the sole reason behind this. There's something to running these controlled sub threshold efforts. On we go.",

I'm not particularly fast, but I do believe what I'm getting the best out of what I've got. That's in terms of I have a life, a job, responsibilities and also not wanting to get injured. The reason I'm confident it works is I've followed more traditional training plans , absolutely exactly as they were laid out. For about the same time a week. I wasn't faster at all and didn't seem to improve past a certain point and didn't really feel like I was ever fresh or ready for any of the workouts. I'm guessing you will never try this, but I think the main thing that would shock people is how this doesn't feel particularly hard week after week or month after month. There's no killing yourself sessions, there's no session you dread. The main issue you will encounter is maybe boredom or the urge to actually go faster. That is probably the biggest issue I see people running into. For what it's worth, I trained like this for cycling for a while. Often with some quizzed looks when I told people or chatted to them after races. But now you will find sub threshold or sweetspot added even as a separate zone when you use FTP calculators and it's much more mainstream and widely accepted that it's a very good way to train for time crunched people. Will it be for running? Who knows. Running is a very odd sport in the fact it seems very much how someone described it a few pages back, in the sense coaches tend to prescribe what they prescribe, just because that's how it's \"done\". If you said to someone 30 years ago cycling would be a metrics driven sport, people would have laughed and said that's for the geeks like Chris Boardman training with his funny gadget, the power meter. 30 years on, if you aren't training with an understanding of metrics and training loads , you are not competing.",

It is a spectrum and we have ended up on a part of it that allows us to see sustainable progress. I've run my PBs in 2021 off of traditional Daniels training, but I stagnated in a frustrating manner of the next two years. I can now see room for improvement again with this system. Like sirpoc mentions, I hardly feel beat up after these long, controlled sub threshold efforts. Yesterday's VO2 Max session? Quiet the opposite. I felt a noticeable fatigue and soreness post workout, and my recovery metrics from the Garmin mirrors that completely.

    "msg": "IMO the training load/CTL and TSS gets to the heart of why this works. Whilst those metrics are far from perfect, as I've explained I feel like they offer a lot and I still don't think there has been anything, to date, better to replace it. I also am firm in believing still as long as you collate and collect data accurately with regards to current fitness, you can index your own personal CTL to your current fitness. The data isn't transferable in any meaningful form to say \"person A is faster than person B, because person A has a higher CTL\". As in, if my CTL is 50 (To pick a number) - if I can get it to 51 I'll likely be fitter and probably faster in a 5k. If I can get it to 54, I'll almost certainly be faster. For someone else, their CTL might only be 40 to run the same 5k time as me. But again, relative to themselves, if they can get their CTL to 45, they'll almost certainly be faster. To get higher, you have to do some more work, relative to the sliding scale of what you have done previously in your training. So , for me, in simplistic terms, this makes total sense. Whilst there are some flaws and gaps in how an individual session for TSS is calculated, the good news I feel is that it seems to work very well, around this sweetspot level. This is again something I have picked up from cycling. I do feel like it probably underestimates a bit if you go by pace or HR, for the really hard running sessions, hills, vo2 max etc. That's the disadvantage of not having power. As per your example. Let's take a basic 7 hour week and that fits pretty neatly. Let's use rough numbers (they aren't exact) but give a good ball park. Runner 1 (you) 3 moderate runs of 50-55 ish mins 60 TSS per session. = 180 TSS 1 Daniels tempo half hour with warm up and down. 70TSS 1 easy active recovery run of say 40-45 mins. 30 TSS. 1 long run 80 mins. Easy 75 TSS. 8X800 around 5k pace with warm up and down. Around 60 TSS. That gives you around 415 TSS for a week. Runner B (me, this was literally my last week to use a real example) 3x 55 mins top end of easy around 52 TSS per run. 156 TSS 3x sub threshold runs around an hour with 35-36 minutes work + warm up and down 75 TSS per run. 225 TSS. Long Run easy 75 mins . 73 TSS. 454 TSS for the week. Whilst that doesn't sound like much difference, over time it will create a reasonably difference in overall training load. Probably enough to account for that differences in the 5ks I've set, for about the same amount of hours a week training. From a personal standpoint, also not having to run the Daniels straight tempo or especially the vo2 max stuff, also keeps me feeling fresher and less beat up in the legs.
